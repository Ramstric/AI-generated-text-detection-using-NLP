Are Advanced Potentials Anomalous?,"  Advanced electromagnetic potentials are indigenous to the classical Maxwell
theory. Generally however they are deemed undesirable and are forcibly
excluded, destroying the theory's inherent time-symmetry. We investigate the
reason for this, pointing out that it is not necessary and in some cases is
counter-productive. We then focus on the direct-action theory in which the
advanced and retarded contributions are present symmetrically, with no
opportunity to supplement the particular integral solution of the wave equation
with an arbitrary complementary function. One then requires a plausible
explanation for the observed broken symmetry that, commonly, is understood
cannot be met by the Wheeler-Feynman mechanism because the necessary boundary
condition cannot be satisfied in acceptable cosmologies. We take this
opportunity to argue that the boundary condition is already met by all
expanding cosmologies simply as a result of cosmological red-shift. A
consequence is that the cosmological and thermodynamic arrows of time can be
equated, the direct action version of EM is preferred, and that advanced
potentials are ubiquitous.

Percolation transition in networks with degree-degree correlation,"  We introduce an exponential random graph model for networks with a fixed
degree distribution and with a tunable degree-degree correlation. We then
investigate the nature of a percolation transition in the correlated network
with the Poisson degree distribution. It is found that negative correlation is
irrelevant in that the percolation transition in the disassortative network
belongs to the same universality class of the uncorrelated network. Positive
correlation turns out to be relevant. The percolation transition in the
assortative network is characterized by the non-diverging mean size of finite
clusters and power-law scalings of the density of the largest cluster and the
cluster size distribution in the non-percolating phase as well as at the
critical point. Our results suggest that the unusual type percolation
transition in the growing network models reported recently may be inherited

"Modeling of torsion stress giant magnetoimpedance in amorphous wires

magnetoimpedance in amorphous wires with negative magnetostriction is proposed.
The wire impedance is found by means of the solution of Maxwell equations
together with the Landau-Lifshitz equation, assuming a simplified spatial

The impedance is analyzed as a function of the external magnetic field, torsion
stress and frequency. It is shown that the magnetoimpedance ratio torsion

"A new Determination of the Extragalactic Background of Diffuse Gamma
  Rays taking into account Dark Matter Annihilation","  The extragalactic background (EGB) of diffuse gamma rays can be determined by
subtracting the Galactic contribution from the data. This requires a Galactic
model (GM) and we include for the first time the contribution of dark matter
annihilation (DMA), which was previously proposed as an explanation for the
EGRET excess of diffuse Galactic gamma rays above 1 GeV.
  In this paper it is shown that the newly determined EGB shows a

The bump is shown to be compatible with a contribution from an extragalactic
DMA signal from weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) with a mass
between 50 and 100 GeV in agreement with the EGRET excess of the Galactic

In a wide range of temperatures, we find that both the decay time and the
amplitude of these coherent oscillations remain nearly unaffected by thermal
fluctuations. The oscillations are observed well above the crossover
temperature from thermally activated escape to quantum tunneling for undriven
qubits. In the two-level limit, coherent qubit response rapidly vanishes as
soon as the energy of thermal fluctuations kT becomes larger than the energy

Relaxation dynamics in fluids of platelike colloidal particles,"  The relaxation dynamics of a model fluid of platelike colloidal particles is
investigated by means of a phenomenological dynamic density functional theory.
The model fluid approximates the particles within the Zwanzig model of
restricted orientations. The driving force for time-dependence is expressed
completely by gradients of the local chemical potential which in turn is
derived from a density functional -- hydrodynamic interactions are not taken
into account. These approximations are expected to lead to qualitatively
reliable results for low densities as those within the isotropic-nematic
two-phase region. The formalism is applied to model an initially spatially
homogeneous stable or metastable isotropic fluid which is perturbed by
switching a two-dimensional array of Gaussian laser beams. Switching on the
laser beams leads to an accumulation of colloidal particles in the beam
centers. If the initial chemical potential and the laser power are large enough
a preferred orientation of particles occurs breaking the symmetry of the laser
potential. After switching off the laser beams again the system can follow
different relaxation paths: It either relaxes back to the homogeneous isotropic
state or it forms an approximately elliptical high-density core which is
elongated perpendicular to the dominating orientation in order to minimize the
surface free energy. For large supersaturations of the initial isotropic fluid
the high-density cores of neighboring laser beams of the two-dimensional array
merge into complex superstructures.

three-dimensional shell located in the GC region with nested layers of ionized,
magnetized, and mid-IR--emitting components. I compare the physical conditions

An Energy Efficiency Perspective on Training for Fading Channels,"  In this paper, the bit energy requirements of training-based transmission
over block Rayleigh fading channels are studied. Pilot signals are employed to
obtain the minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) estimate of the channel fading
coefficients. Energy efficiency is analyzed in the worst case scenario where
the channel estimate is assumed to be perfect and the error in the estimate is
considered as another source of additive Gaussian noise. It is shown that bit
energy requirement grows without bound as the snr goes to zero, and the minimum
bit energy is achieved at a nonzero snr value below which one should not
operate. The effect of the block length on both the minimum bit energy and the
snr value at which the minimum is achieved is investigated. Flash training
schemes are analyzed and shown to improve the energy efficiency in the low-snr
regime. Energy efficiency analysis is also carried out when peak power
constraints are imposed on pilot signals.

An Energy Efficiency Perspective on Training for Fading Channels,"The research paper titled ""An Energy Efficiency Perspective on Training for Fading Channels"" focuses on the tradeoff between energy efficiency and channel estimation accuracy in wireless communication systems. The paper proposes a new training method that optimizes the energy efficiency of channel estimation while maintaining a satisfactory level of accuracy.

Performance Analysis for Multichannel Reception of OOFSK Signaling,"  In this paper, the error performance of on-off frequency shift keying (OOFSK)
modulation over fading channels is analyzed when the receiver is equipped with
multiple antennas. The analysis is conducted in two cases: the coherent
scenario where the fading is perfectly known at the receiver, and the
noncoherent scenario where neither the receiver nor the transmitter knows the
fading coefficients. For both cases, the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP)
detection rule is derived and analytical probability of error expressions are
obtained. The effect of fading correlation among the receiver antennas is also
studied. Simulation results indicate that for sufficiently low duty cycle
values, lower probability of error values with respect to FSK signaling are
achieved. Equivalently, when compared to FSK modulation, OOFSK with low duty
cycle requires less energy to achieve the same probability of error, which
renders this modulation a more energy efficient transmission technique.

Symmetry Relations for Trajectories of a Brownian Motor,"  A Brownian Motor is a nanoscale or molecular device that combines the effects
of thermal noise, spatial or temporal asymmetry, and directionless input energy

transition is the exponent of the change in the internal energy of the system

Are Superhumps Good Measures of the Mass Ratio for AM CVn Systems?,"  We extend recent work that included the effect of pressure forces to derive
the precession rate of eccentric accretion discs in cataclysmic variables to

the effect, we find that there is no scaling that applies consistently to all
the systems in the class. We discuss the reasons for the lack of a superhump
period to mass ratio relationship analogous to that known for SU UMa systems
and suggest that this is because these secondaries do not have a single valued
mass-radius relationship. We highlight the unreliability of mass-ratios derived
by applying the SU UMa expression to the AM CVn binaries.

"G\""odel Incompleteness and the Black Hole Information Paradox","  Semiclassical reasoning suggests that the process by which an object
collapses into a black hole and then evaporates by emitting Hawking radiation
may destroy information, a problem often referred to as the black hole
information paradox. Further, there seems to be no unique prediction of where
the information about the collapsing body is localized. We propose that the
latter aspect of the paradox may be a manifestation of an inconsistent
self-reference in the semiclassical theory of black hole evolution. This
suggests the inadequacy of the semiclassical approach or, at worst, that
standard quantum mechanics and general relavity are fundamentally incompatible.
One option for the resolution for the paradox in the localization is to
identify the G\""odel-like incompleteness that corresponds to an imposition of
consistency, and introduce possibly new physics that supplies this
incompleteness. Another option is to modify the theory in such a way as to
prohibit self-reference. We discuss various possible scenarios to implement
these options, including eternally collapsing objects, black hole remnants,
black hole final states, and simple variants of semiclassical quantum gravity.

"An Analysis of the Shapes of Interstellar Extinction Curves. V. The
  IR-Through-UV Curve Morphology","  We study the IR-through-UV interstellar extinction curves towards 328
Galactic B and late-O stars. We use a new technique which employs stellar
atmosphere models in lieu of unreddened ""standard"" stars. This technique is
capable of virtually eliminating spectral mismatch errors in the curves. It
also allows a quantitative assessment of the errors and enables a rigorous
testing of the significance of relationships between various curve parameters,
regardless of whether their uncertainties are correlated. Analysis of the
curves gives the following results: (1) In accord with our previous findings,
the central position of the 2175 A extinction bump is mildly variable, its
width is highly variable, and the two variations are unrelated. (2) Strong
correlations are found among some extinction properties within the UV region,
and within the IR region. (3) With the exception of a few curves with extreme
(i.e., large) values of R(V), the UV and IR portions of Galactic extinction
curves are not correlated with each other. (4) The large sightline-to-sightline
variation seen in our sample implies that any average Galactic extinction curve
will always reflect the biases of its parent sample. (5) The use of an average
curve to deredden a spectral energy distribution (SED) will result in
significant errors, and a realistic error budget for the dereddened SED must
include the observed variance of Galactic curves. While the observed large
sightline-to-sightline variations, and the lack of correlation among the
various features of the curves, make it difficult to meaningfully characterize

Accreting Neutron Stars in Low-Mass X-Ray Binary Systems,"  Using the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RossiXTE), astronomers have discovered
that disk-accreting neutron stars with weak magnetic fields produce three
distinct types of high-frequency X-ray oscillations. These oscillations are
powered by release of the binding energy of matter falling into the strong
gravitational field of the star or by the sudden nuclear burning of matter that
has accumulated in the outermost layers of the star. The frequencies of the
oscillations reflect the orbital frequencies of gas deep in the gravitational
field of the star and/or the spin frequency of the star. These oscillations can
therefore be used to explore fundamental physics, such as strong-field gravity
and the properties of matter under extreme conditions, and important
astrophysical questions, such as the formation and evolution of millisecond
pulsars. Observations using RossiXTE have shown that some two dozen neutron
stars in low-mass X-ray binary systems have the spin rates and magnetic fields
required to become millisecond radio-emitting pulsars when accretion ceases,
but that few have spin rates above about 600 Hz. The properties of these stars
show that the paucity of spin rates greater than 600 Hz is due in part to the
magnetic braking component of the accretion torque and to the limited amount of
angular momentum that can be accreted in such systems. Further study will show
whether braking by gravitational radiation is also a factor. Analysis of the
kilohertz oscillations has provided the first evidence for the existence of the
innermost stable circular orbit around dense relativistic stars that is
predicted by strong-field general relativity. It has also greatly narrowed the

"Dark energy constraints from cosmic shear power spectra: impact of
  intrinsic alignments on photometric redshift requirements","  Cosmic shear constrains cosmology by exploiting the apparent alignments of
pairs of galaxies due to gravitational lensing by intervening mass clumps.
However galaxies may become (intrinsically) aligned with each other, and with
nearby mass clumps, during their formation. This effect needs to be
disentangled from the cosmic shear signal to place constraints on cosmology. We
use the linear intrinsic alignment model as a base and compare it to an
alternative model and data. If intrinsic alignments are ignored then the dark
energy equation of state is biased by ~50 per cent. We examine how the number
of tomographic redshift bins affects uncertainties on cosmological parameters
and find that when intrinsic alignments are included two or more times as many
bins are required to obtain 80 per cent of the available information. We
investigate how the degradation in the dark energy figure of merit depends on
the photometric redshift scatter. Previous studies have shown that lensing does
not place stringent requirements on the photometric redshift uncertainty, so
long as the uncertainty is well known. However, if intrinsic alignments are
included the requirements become a factor of three tighter. These results are
quite insensitive to the fraction of catastrophic outliers, assuming that this
fraction is well known. We show the effect of uncertainties in photometric
redshift bias and scatter. Finally we quantify how priors on the intrinsic
alignment model would improve dark energy constraints.

Brownian subordinators and fractional Cauchy problems,"  A Brownian time process is a Markov process subordinated to the absolute
value of an independent one-dimensional Brownian motion. Its transition
densities solve an initial value problem involving the square of the generator
of the original Markov process. An apparently unrelated class of processes,
emerging as the scaling limits of continuous time random walks, involve
subordination to the inverse or hitting time process of a classical stable
subordinator. The resulting densities solve fractional Cauchy problems, an
extension that involves fractional derivatives in time. In this paper, we will
show a close and unexpected connection between these two classes of processes,
and consequently, an equivalence between these two families of partial
differential equations.

Beyond Caustic Crossings: Properties of Binary Microlensing Light Curves,"  Binary microlensing light curves have a variety of morphologies. Many are
indistinguishable from point lens light curves. Of those that deviate from the
point lens form, caustic crossing light curves have tended to dominate
identified binary lens events. Other distinctive signatures of binary lenses
include significant asymmetry, multiple peaks, and repeating events. We have
quantified, using high resolution simulations, the theoretically expected
relative numbers of each type of binary lens event, based on its measurable
characteristics. We find that a microlensing survey with current levels of
photometric uncertainty and sampling should find at least as many non-caustic
crossing binary lens events as caustic crossing events; in future surveys with
more sensitive photometry, the contribution of distinctive non-caustic crossing
events will be even greater. To try to explain why caustic crossing light
curves appear to be so dominant among the published binary lensing events, we
investigate the influence of several physical effects, including blending,
sampling rate, and various binary populations.

Radiation hardness of diamond and silicon sensors compared,"  The radiation hardness of silicon charged particle sensors is compared with
single crystal and polycrystalline diamond sensors, both experimentally and
theoretically. It is shown that for Si- and C-sensors, the NIEL hypothesis,
which states that the signal loss is proportional to the Non-Ionizing Energy
Loss, is a good approximation to the present data. At incident proton and
neutron energies well above 0.1 GeV the radiation damage is dominated by the
inelastic cross section, while at non-relativistic energies the elastic cross
section prevails. The smaller inelastic nucleon-Carbon cross section and the
light nuclear fragments imply that at high energies diamond is an order of

Topological insulators beyond the Brillouin zone via Chern parity,"  The topological insulator is an electronic phase stabilized by spin-orbit
coupling that supports propagating edge states and is not adiabatically
connected to the ordinary insulator. In several ways it is a spin-orbit-induced
analogue in time-reversal-invariant systems of the integer quantum Hall effect
(IQHE). This paper studies the topological insulator phase in disordered
two-dimensional systems, using a model graphene Hamiltonian introduced by Kane
and Mele as an example. The nonperturbative definition of a topological
insulator given here is distinct from previous efforts in that it involves
boundary phase twists that couple only to charge, does not refer to edge
states, and can be measured by pumping cycles of ordinary charge. In this
definition, the phase of a Slater determinant of electronic states is
determined by a Chern parity analogous to Chern number in the IQHE case.
Numerically we find, in agreement with recent network model studies, that the
direct transition between ordinary and topological insulators that occurs in
band structures is a consequence of the perfect crystalline lattice.
Generically these two phases are separated by a metallic phase, which is
allowed in two dimensions when spin-orbit coupling is present. The same
approach can be used to study three-dimensional topological insulators.

  air-water interface","  At the air/water interface, 4,-8-alkyl[1,1,-biphenyl]-4-carbonitrile (8CB)
domains with different thicknesses coexist in the same Langmuir film, as
multiple bilayers on a monolayer. The edge dislocation at the domain boundary

observing the domain relaxation process starting from small distortions, we
find that the line tension is linearly dependent on the thickness difference
between the coexisting phases in the film. Comparisons with theoretical
treatments in the literature suggest that the edge dislocation at the boundary
locates near the center of the film, which means that the 8CB multilayers are

Non-abelian plasma instabilities for strong anisotropy,"  We numerically investigate gauge field instabilities in anisotropic SU(2)
plasmas using weak field initial conditions. The growth of unstable modes is
stopped by non-abelian effects for moderate anisotropy. If we increase the
anisotropy the growth continues beyond the non-abelian saturation bound. We
find strong indications that the continued growth is not due to over-saturation
of infrared field modes, but instead due to very rapid growth of high momentum
modes which are not unstable in the weak field limit. The saturation amplitude
strongly depends on the initial conditions. For strong initial fields we do not
observe the sustained growth.

Is there contextuality for a single qubit?,"  It was presented by Cabello and Nakamura [A. Cabello, Phys. Rev. Lett. 90,
190401 (2003)], that the Kochen-Specker theorem applies to two dimensions if
one uses Positive Operator-Valued Measures. We show that contextuality in their
models is not of the Kochen-Specker type. It is rather the result of not
keeping track of the whole system on which the measurement is performed. This
is connected to the fact that there is no one-to-one correspondence between
POVM elements and projectors on the extended Hilbert space and the same POVM
element has to originate from two different projectors when used in Cabello's

The stability of poloidal magnetic fields in rotating stars,"  The stability of large-scale magnetic fields in rotating stars is explored,
using 3D numerical hydrodynamics to follow the evolution of an initial poloidal
field. It is found that the field is subject to an instability, located
initially on the magnetic equator, whereby the gas is displaced in a direction
parallel to the magnetic axis. If the magnetic axis is parallel to the rotation
axis, the rotation does not affect the initial linear growth of the
instability, but does restrict the growth of the instability outside of the
equatorial zone. The magnetic energy decays on a timescale which is a function
of the Alfv\'en crossing time and the rotation speed, but short compared to any
evolutionary timescale. No evidence is found for a possible stable end state to
evolve from an initial axisymmetric poloidal field. The field of an oblique

Neutral genetic drift can aid functional protein evolution,"  BACKGROUND: Many of the mutations accumulated by naturally evolving proteins
are neutral in the sense that they do not significantly alter a protein's
ability to perform its primary biological function. However, new protein
functions evolve when selection begins to favor other, ""promiscuous"" functions
that are incidental to a protein's biological role. If mutations that are
neutral with respect to a protein's primary biological function cause
substantial changes in promiscuous functions, these mutations could enable
future functional evolution.
  RESULTS: Here we investigate this possibility experimentally by examining how
cytochrome P450 enzymes that have evolved neutrally with respect to activity on
a single substrate have changed in their abilities to catalyze reactions on
five other substrates. We find that the enzymes have sometimes changed as much
as four-fold in the promiscuous activities. The changes in promiscuous
activities tend to increase with the number of mutations, and can be largely
rationalized in terms of the chemical structures of the substrates. The
activities on chemically similar substrates tend to change in a coordinated
fashion, potentially providing a route for systematically predicting the change
in one function based on the measurement of several others.
  CONCLUSIONS: Our work suggests that initially neutral genetic drift can lead
to substantial changes in protein functions that are not currently under
selection, in effect poising the proteins to more readily undergo functional
evolution should selection ""ask new questions"" in the future.

"Evaporation of buffer gas-thermalized anions out of a multipole rf ion
  trap","  We identify plain evaporation of ions as the fundamental loss mechanism out
of a multipole ion trap. Using thermalized negative Cl- ions we find that the
evaporative loss rate is proportional to a Boltzmann factor. This thermodynamic
description sheds new light on the dynamics of particles in time-varying
confining potentials. It specifically allows us to extract the effective depth
of the ion trap as the activation energy for evaporation. As a function of the
rf amplitude we find two distinct regimes related to the stability of motion of
the trapped ions. For low amplitudes the entire trap allows for stable motion
and the trap depth increases with the rf field. For larger rf amplitudes,
however, rapid energy transfer from the field to the ion motion can occur at
large trap radii, which leads to a reduction of the effective trapping volume.
In this regime the trap depth decreases again with increasing rf amplitude. We
give an analytical parameterization of the trap depth for various multipole
traps that allows predictions of the most favorable trapping conditions.

disturbance. A selective phase rotation is needed to obtain the imaginary part.
This leads to a complex quasiprobability, the Kirkwood distribution. We show
that the Kirkwood distribution contains full information about the state if the
two observables are maximal and complementary. The Kirkwood distribution gives
a new picture of state reduction. In a nonselective measurement, the
modification term vanishes. A selective measurement leads to a quantum state as

Spin-polarized transport in II-VI magnetic resonant tunneling devices,"  We investigate electronic transport through II-VI semiconductor resonant
tunneling structures containing diluted magnetic impurities. Due to the
exchange interaction between the conduction electrons and the impurities, there
arises a giant Zeeman splitting in the presence of a moderately low magnetic

current-voltage characteristics shows two peaks corresponding to transport for
each spin channel. This behavior is experimentally observed and can be
reproduced with a simple tunneling model. The model thus allows to analyze
other configurations. First, we further increase the magnetic field, which
leads to a spin polarization of the electronic current injected from the leads,
thus giving rise to a relative change in the current amplitude. We demonstrate
that the spin polarization in the emitter can be determined from such a change.
Furthermore, in the case of a magnetically doped injector our model shows a
large increase in peak amplitude and a shift of the resonance to higher
voltages as the external field increases. We find that this effect arises from
a combination of giant Zeeman splitting, 3-D incident distribution and broad

Decoherence of Highly Mixed Macroscopic Quantum Superpositions,"  It is known that a macroscopic quantum superposition (MQS), when it is

the evolution of a highly mixed MQS interacting with an environment, and
compare it with that of a pure MQS having the same size of the central distance
between its component states. Although the decoherence develops more rapidly
for the mixed MQS in short times, its rate can be significantly suppressed
after a certain time and becomes smaller than the decoherence rate of its
corresponding pure MQS. In an optics experiment to generate a MQS, our result
has a practical implication that nonclassicality of a MQS can be still

close orbiting extrasolar giant planet HD 75289b. We obtained ~230 spectra in
the wavelength range 2.18 - 2.19 microns using the Phoenix spectrograph at
Gemini South. By considering the direct spectrum, derived from irradiated model
atmospheres, we search for the absorption profile signature present in the
combined star and planet light. Since the planetary spectrum is separated from
the stellar spectrum at most phases, we apply a phase dependent orbital model
and tomographic techniques to search for absorption signatures.
  Because the absorption signature lies buried in the noise of a single
exposure we apply a multiline deconvolution to the spectral lines available in
order to boost the effective S/N ratio of the data. The wavelength coverage of
80 angstroms is expected to contain ~100 planetary lines, enabling a mean line
with S/N ratio of ~800 to be achieved after deconvolution. We are nevertheless
unable to detect the presence of the planet in the data and carry out further
simulations to show that broader wavelength coverage should enable a planet
like HD 75289b to be detected with 99.9 per cent (4 sigma) confidence. We
investigate the sensitivity of our method and estimate detection tolerances for
mismatches between observed and model planetary atmospheres.

J1128+592: a highly variable IDV source,"  Short time-scale radio variations of compact extragalactic radio quasars and
blazars known as IntraDay Variability (IDV) can be explained in at least some
sources as a propagation effect; the variations are interpreted as
scintillation of radio waves in the turbulent interstellar medium of the Milky
Way. One of the most convincing observational arguments in favor of a
propagation-induced variability scenario is the observed annual modulation in
the characteristic time scale of the variation due to the Earth's orbital
motion. So far there are only two sources known with a well-constrained
seasonal cycle. Annual modulation has been proposed for a few other less
well-documented objects. However, for some other IDV sources source-intrinsic
structural variations which cause drastic changes in the variability time scale
were also suggested. J1128+592 is a recently discovered, highly variable IDV

"Ferrodistortive instability at the (001) surface of half-metallic
  manganites","  We present the structure of the fully relaxed (001) surface of the
half-metallic manganite La0.7Sr0.3MnO3, calculated using density functional
theory within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). Two relevant
ferroelastic order parameters are identified and characterized: The tilting of
the oxygen octahedra, which is present in the bulk phase, oscillates and
decreases towards the surface, and an additional ferrodistortive Mn
off-centering, triggered by the surface, decays monotonically into the bulk.
The narrow d-like energy band that is characteristic of unrelaxed manganite
surfaces is shifted down in energy by these structural distortions, retaining
its uppermost layer localization. The magnitude of the zero-temperature
magnetization is unchanged from its bulk value, but the effective spin-spin
interactions are reduced at the surface.

"Angular Momentum Transport in Accretion Disks: Scaling Laws in

vertical magnetic field, the sound speed, the vertical size of the box, and the
numerical resolution and predicts accurately the results of 35 numerical

magnetic flux depend linearly on the numerical resolution and would become
negligible if the resolution were set equal to the natural dissipation scale in
astrophysical disks. We conclude that, in order for MRI-driven turbulent
angular momentum transport to be able to account for the large value of the

"Ongoing Galactic Accretion: Simulations and Observations of Condensed

via the unstable cooling of the baryonic halo into condensed clouds. These
clouds have been identified as analogous to the High-Velocity Clouds (HVCs)
observed in HI in our Galaxy. Here we compare the distribution of HVCs observed
around our own Galaxy and extra-planar gas around the Andromeda galaxy to these
possible HVC analogs in a simulation of galaxy formation that naturally
generates these condensed clouds. We find a very good correspondence between
these observations and the simulation, in terms of number, angular size,
velocity distribution, overall flux and flux distribution of the clouds. We
show that condensed cloud accretion only accounts for ~ 0.2 M_solar / year of
the current overall Galactic accretion in the simulations. We also find that
the simulated halo clouds accelerate and become more massive as they fall
toward the disk. The parameter space of the simulated clouds is consistent with
all of the observed HVC complexes that have distance constraints, except the
Magellanic Stream which is known to have a different origin. We also find that
nearly half of these simulated halo clouds would be indistinguishable from
lower-velocity gas and that this effect is strongest further from the disk of
the galaxy, thus indicating a possible missing population of HVCs. These
results indicate that the majority of HVCs are consistent with being infalling,

finite degrees of triaxiality are a better fit than purely axisymmetric cores
although cores close to axisymmetry are not excluded by the data. The incidence

"Symmetric and asymmetric solitons in linearly coupled Bose-Einstein

quasi-one-dimensional traps, equipped with optical lattices (OLs) and filled
with a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The cores are linearly coupled by
tunneling. Analysis of the corresponding system of linearly coupled
Gross-Pitaevskii equations (GPEs) reveals that spectral bandgaps of the single
GPE split into subgaps. Symmetry breaking in two-component BEC solitons is
studied in cases of the attractive (AA) and repulsive (RR) nonlinearity in both
traps; the mixed situation, with repulsion in one trap and attraction in the
other (RA), is considered too. In all the cases, stable asymmetric solitons are
found, bifurcating from symmetric or antisymmetric ones (and destabilizing
them), in the AA and RR systems, respectively. In either case, bi-stability is
predicted, with a nonbifurcating stable branch, either antisymmetric or
symmetric, coexisting with asymmetric ones. Solitons destabilized by the
bifurcation tend to rearrange themselves into their stable asymmetric
counterparts. The impact of a phase mismatch, between the OLs in the two cores
is also studied. Also considered is a related model, for a binary BEC in a
single-core trap with the OL, assuming that the two species (representing
different spin states of the same atom) are coupled by linear interconversion.
In that case, the symmetry-breaking bifurcations in the AA and RR models switch

Combination of OFDM and CDMA for high data rate UWB,"  For Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) systems, resource allocation
between several users within a piconet and the coexistence of several piconets
are very important points to take into consideration for the optimization of
high data rate Ultra Wide Band (UWB) systems. To improve the performance of the
Multi-Band OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex) solution proposed by
the Multi-Band OFDM Alliance (MBOA), the addition of a spreading component in
the frequency domain is a good solution since it makes resource allocation
easier and also offers better robustness against channel frequency selectivity
and narrowband interference. The Spread Spectrum - Multi-Carrier - Multiple
Access (SS-MC-MA) system proposed in this article offers not only the
advantages of Multi-Carrier - Coded Division Multiple Access (MC-CDMA) brought
by frequency spreading, but also a more effective dynamic resource allocation
in a multi-user and multi-piconet context. These improvements are obtained
without increasing the complexity of the radio-frequency part compared to the
classical MBOA solution.

Combination of OFDM and CDMA for high data rate UWB,"The paper titled ""Combination of OFDM and CDMA for high data rate UWB"" discusses the use of a combination of two wireless communication techniques, namely, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), for achieving high data rates in Ultra Wideband (UWB) communication systems.

The authors explain the benefits of using this combination, such as high spectral efficiency, improved data security, and low power consumption. They also present simulation results to show the effectiveness of the proposed system in achieving high data rates. Overall, the paper concludes that the combination of OFDM and CDMA is a promising technique for achieving high data rates in UWB communication systems.",True,1
Phenomenology of the nMSSM from colliders to cosmology,"  Low energy supersymmetric models provide a solution to the hierarchy problem
and also have the necessary ingredients to solve two of the most outstanding
issues in cosmology: the origin of dark matter and baryonic matter. One of the
most attractive features of this framework is that the relevant physical
processes are related to interactions at the weak scale and therefore may be
tested in collider experiments in the near future. This is true for the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) as well as for its extension with the
addition of one singlet chiral superfield, the so-called nMSSM. It has been
recently shown that within the nMSSM an elegant solution to both the problem of
baryogenesis and dark matter may be found, that relies mostly on the mixing of
the singlet sector with the Higgs sector of the theory. In this work we review
the nMSSM model constraints from cosmology and present the associated collider
phenomenology at the LHC and the ILC. We show that the ILC will efficiently
probe the neutralino, chargino and Higgs sectors, allowing to confront
cosmological observations with computations based on collider measurements. We
also investigate the prospects for a direct detection of dark matter and the
constraints imposed by the current bounds of the electron electric dipole
moment in this model.

Phenomenology of the nMSSM from colliders to cosmology,"The Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (nMSSM) is an extension of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) that includes a singlet superfield.

In this paper, we explore the phenomenology of the nMSSM, focusing on its implications for collider physics and cosmology. We discuss the different collider signatures of the nMSSM and compare them to those of the MSSM. We also investigate the constraints on the nMSSM from cosmology, such as dark matter relic abundance, direct and indirect detection, and the Higgs boson mass. We find that the nMSSM can accommodate a wide range of experimental and observational data, and that it remains a viable and attractive candidate for physics beyond the Standard Model. Our analysis highlights the importance of a global and comprehensive approach to model building and testing, which can shed light on the fundamental nature of the universe.",True,1
Mixing navigation on networks,"  In this Letter, we proposed a mixing navigation mechanism, which interpolates
between random-walk and shortest-path protocol. The navigation efficiency can
be remarkably enhanced via a few routers. Some advanced strategies are also

a tiny fraction of routers can guarantee an efficient navigation with low and
stable delivery time almost independent of network size. For geographical
localized networks, the clustering strategy can simultaneously increase the

Higgs and Top quark coupled with a conformal gauge sector,"  We propose a dynamical scenario beyond the standard model, in which the
radiative correction to the Higgs mass parameter is suppressed due to a large
anomalous dimension induced through a conformal invariant coupling with an
extra gauge sector. Then the anomalous dimension also suppresses the Yukawa
couplings of the Higgs field. However, the large top Yukawa coupling can be
generated effectively through mixing among top quarks and the fermions of the
conformal gauge sector. This scenario is found to predict a fairly heavy Higgs
mass of about 500 GeV. We present an explicit model and show consistency with
the Electro-Weak precision measurements of the S and T parameters as well as
the Z boson decay width.

Quasars Lensed by Globular Clusters of Spiral and Elliptical Galaxies,"  Based on the SDSS catalog, we have found new close quasar-galaxy pairs.
Quasars projected onto the halos of nearer galaxies are encountered among the
multitude of quasars observed at various distances from us. Among them there
are quasars that are close to the galaxies not only in angular separation, but
also in redshift. Such quasar-galaxy pairs are called close pairs. We developed
further the hypothesis that such pairs appear, because the fluxer on the
nucleus of the more distant galaxy passes through halo globular clusters of the
nearer galaxy,resulting in magnification and splitting of the image of the
source that we interpret as a quasar. To corroborate this hypothesis, we
analyzed the distribution of quasars in the plane of the halos of these
galaxies. The quasars from close pairs were found to follow the density profile
of globular clusters in the halos of elliptical and spiral galaxies with slopes
of -1.5 and -2.4 for elliptical and spiral galaxies, respectively. This
suggests that quasars do not appear near galaxies by chance and that quasars
are associated with galaxies via halo globular clusters.

SDSSJ104341.53+085558.2: A second white dwarf with a gaseous debris disc,"  Intermediate resolution spectroscopy of the white dwarf
SDSSJ104341.53+085558.2 contains double-peaked emission lines of
CaII8498,8542,8662 and identifies this object to be the second single white
dwarf to be surrounded by a gaseous disc of metal-rich material, similar to the
recently discovered SDSSJ1228+1040. A photospheric Magnesium abundance of 0.3
times the solar value, determined from the observed MgII4481 absorption line,
implies that the white dwarf is accreting from the circumstellar material. The
absence of Balmer emission lines and of photospheric HeI4471 absorption
indicates that the accreted material is depleted in volatile elements and, by
analogy with SDSS1228+1040, may be the result of the tidal disruption of an
asteroid. Additional spectroscopy of the DAZ white dwarfs WD1337+705 and GD362
does not reveal CaII emission lines. GD362 is one of the few cool DAZ that
display strong infrared flux excess, thought to be originating in a
circumstellar dust disc, and its temperature is likely too low to sublimate
sufficient amounts of disc material to generate detectable CaII emission.
WD1337+705 is, as SDSS1228+1040 and SDSS1043+0855, moderately hot, but has the
lowest Mg abundance of those three stars, suggesting a possible correlation
between the photospheric Mg abundance and the equivalent width of the CaII
emission triplet. Our inspection of 7360 white dwarfs from SDSS DR4 fails to

Parallel Transport and Functors,"The research paper titled ""Parallel Transport and Functors"" by Peter W. Michor explores the concept of parallel transport and functors in differential geometry. The main objective of the paper is to establish a connection between the two concepts and to demonstrate their usefulness in various settings, including Riemannian geometry, gauge theory, and geometric mechanics.
The paper begins by introducing the concept of parallel transport, which is the process of transporting a vector or tensor along a curve without changing its direction. The author then goes on to discuss the mathematical framework of functors, which are mappings between categories that preserve certain properties.
The paper establishes a connection between parallel transport and functors by showing that parallel transport can be understood as a functor between the category of curves and the category of vector or tensor fields. The author then applies this concept to various settings, such as Riemannian geometry, where the functorial approach is used to define the Levi-Civita connection, and gauge theory, where it is used to define the connection on a principal bundle.
The paper concludes by demonstrating the usefulness of the functorial approach in geometric mechanics, where it is used to define the notion of a covariant derivative on the space of curves. The author also discusses the potential for further research in this area, including the study of functors between more general categories and their applications in other areas of mathematics and physics.

"A cold metal-poor cloud traced by a weak MgII absorption at z~0.45.
  First detection of SiI, CaI and FeI in a QSO absorber","  We present the observations of a weak MgII absorption system detected at
z~0.452 in the UVES high resolution spectrum of the QSO HE0001-2340. The weaker
of the two MgII components forming the system shows associated absorptions due
to SiI, CaI and FeI observed for the first time in a QSO spectrum. We
investigate the nature of this absorber by comparing its properties with those
of different classes of absorbers (weak MgII, Damped Ly-alpha systems and local
interstellar clouds) and reproducing its ionization conditions with
photoionization models. The observed absorber belongs to the class of weak MgII
systems on the basis of its equivalent width, however the relative strength of
commonly observed transitions deviates significantly from those of the above
mentioned absorbers. A rough estimate of the probability to cross such a system
with a QSO line of sight is P~0.03. The presence of rare neutral transitions
suggests that the cloud is shielded by a large amount of neutral hydrogen. A
detailed comparison of the observed column densities with the average
properties of damped Ly-alpha systems and local interstellar cold clouds shows,
in particular, deficient MgII/MgI and CaII/CaI ratios in our cloud. The results
of photoionization models indicate that the cloud could be ionized by the UV
background. However, a simple model of a single cloud with uniform density
cannot reproduce the observed ionic abundance ratios, suggesting a more complex
density structure for the absorber. Supposing that ionization corrections are
negligible, the most puzzling result is the underabundance of magnesium with
respect to iron which is hard to explain both with nucleosynthesis and with
differential dust depletion. [Abridged]

Modified p-modes in penumbral filaments?,"  Aims: The primary objective of this study is to search for and identify wave
modes within a sunspot penumbra.
  Methods: Infrared spectropolarimetric time series data are inverted using a
model comprising two atmospheric components in each spatial pixel. Fourier
phase difference analysis is performed on the line-of-sight velocities
retrieved from both components to determine time delays between the velocity
signals. In addition, the vertical separation between the signals in the two
components is calculated from the Stokes velocity response functions.
  Results: The inversion yields two atmospheric components, one permeated by a
nearly horizontal magnetic field, the other with a less-inclined magnetic
field. Time delays between the oscillations in the two components in the
frequency range 2.5-4.5 mHz are combined with speeds of atmospheric wave modes
to determine wave travel distances. These are compared to expected path lengths
obtained from response functions of the observed spectral lines in the
different atmospheric components. Fast-mode (i.e., modified p-mode) waves
exhibit the best agreement with the observations when propagating toward the
sunspot at an angle ~50 degrees to the vertical.

"A Note on Conserved Charges of Asymptotically Flat and Anti-de Sitter
  Spaces in Arbitrary Dimensions","  The calculation of conserved charges of black holes is a rich problem, for
which many methods are known. Until recently, there was some controversy on the
proper definition of conserved charges in asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS)
spaces in arbitrary dimensions. This paper provides a systematic and explicit
Hamiltonian derivation of the energy and the angular momenta of both
asymptotically flat and asymptotically AdS spacetimes in any dimension D bigger
or equal to 4. This requires as a first step a precise determination of the
asymptotic conditions of the metric and of its conjugate momentum. These
conditions happen to be achieved in ellipsoidal coordinates adapted to the
rotating solutions.The asymptotic symmetry algebra is found to be isomorphic
either to the Poincare algebra or to the so(D-1, 2) algebra, as expected. In
the asymptotically flat case, the boundary conditions involve a generalization
of the parity conditions, introduced by Regge and Teitelboim, which are
necessary to make the angular momenta finite. The charges are explicitly
computed for Kerr and Kerr-AdS black holes for arbitrary D and they are shown
to be in agreement with thermodynamical arguments.

Sampling using a `bank' of clues,"  An easy-to-implement form of the Metropolis Algorithm is described which,
unlike most standard techniques, is well suited to sampling from multi-modal
distributions on spaces with moderate numbers of dimensions (order ten) in
environments typical of investigations into current constraints on
Beyond-the-Standard-Model physics. The sampling technique makes use of
pre-existing information (which can safely be of low or uncertain quality)
relating to the distribution from which it is desired to sample. This
information should come in the form of a ``bank'' or ``cache'' of space points
of which at least some may be expected to be near regions of interest in the
desired distribution. In practical circumstances such ``banks of clues'' are
easy to assemble from earlier work, aborted runs, discarded burn-in samples
from failed sampling attempts, or from prior scouting investigations. The
technique equilibrates between disconnected parts of the distribution without
user input. The algorithm is not lead astray by ``bad'' clues, but there is no
free lunch: performance gains will only be seen where clues are helpful.

"Vibration-Induced Conductivity Fluctuation Measurement for Soil Bulk
  Density Analysis","  Soil bulk density affects water storage, water and nutrient movement, and
plant root activity in the soil profile. Its measurement is difficult in field
conditions. Vibration-induced conductivity fluctuation was investigated to
quantify soil bulk density with possible field applications in the future. The
AC electrical conductivity of soil was measured using a pair of blade-like
electrodes while exposing the soil to periodic vibration. The blades were
positioned longitudinally and transversally to the direction of the induced
vibration to enable the calculation of a normalized index. The normalized index
was expected to provide data independent from the vibration strength and to
reduce the effect of soil salinity and water content. The experiment was
conducted on natural and salinized fine sand at two moisture conditions and
four bulk densities. The blade-shaped electrodes improved electrode-soil
contact compared to cylindrical electrodes, and thereby, reduced measurement
noise. Simulations on a simplified resistor lattice indicate that the
transversal effect increases as soil bulk density decreases. Measurement of dry
sand showed a negative correlation between the normalized conductivity

form with statistics by identifying the square of field operator with the
inverse of the Fisher information matrix.

Black Hole Accretion in Low States: Electron Heating,"  Plasmas in an accretion flow are heated by MHD turbulence generated through
the magneto-rotational instability. The viscous stress driving the accretion is
intimately connected to the microscopic processes of turbulence dissipation. We
show that, in a few well-observed black hole accretion systems, there is
compelling observational evidence of efficient electron heating by turbulence

two-temperature accretion flow is expected. We consider a Keplerian accretion
flow with a constant mass accretion rate in the pseudo-Newtonian gravitational
potential and take into account the bremsstrahlung, synchrotron, and inverse
Comptonization cooling processes. The critical mass accretion rate, below which
the two-temperature solution may exist, is determined by the cooling processes
and the collisional energy exchanges between electrons and ions and has very

"Dependence of the Local Reionization History on Halo Mass and

is the relative timing of the reionization history of a region and its halo
assembly history, which can affect the nature of the first stars formed in that
region, the properties and radial distribution of its stellar halo, globular
cluster population and its satellite galaxies. We distinguish two basic cases
for the reionization of a halo - internal reionization, whereby the stars
forming in situ reionize their host galaxy, and external reionization, whereby
the progenitor of a galaxy is reionized by external radiation before its own
stars are able to form in sufficient numbers. We use a set of large-scale
radiative transfer and structure formation simulations, based on cosmologies
derived from both WMAP 1-year and WMAP 3-year data, to evaluate the mean
reionization redshifts and the probability of internal/external reionization
for Local Group-like systems, galaxies in the field and central cD galaxies in
clusters. We find that these probabilities are strongly dependent on the
underlying cosmology and the efficiency of photon production, but also on the
halo mass. There is a rapid transition between predominantly external and
predominantly internal reionization at a mass scale of 1.0e12 Msun
(corresponding roughly to L*galaxies), with haloes less massive than this being
reionized preferentially from distant sources. We provide a fit for the
reionization redshift as a function of halo mass, which could be helpful to
parameterize reionization in semi-analytical models of galaxy formation on
cosmological scales. We find no statistical correlation between the

spectrophotometric system. For a few He-weak stars we also estimate the
effective temperatures and the angular diameters by integrating absolute fluxes
observed over a wide spectral range. Non-LTE model calculations are carried out
to study the influence of the He/H abundance ratio on the emergent radiation of
He-strong stars and on their Teff determination. We find that the effective
temperatures, surface gravities and bolometric absolute magnitudes of He-weak
stars estimated with the BCD system and the integrated flux method are in good
agreement between each other, and they also agree with previous determinations
based on several different methods. The mean discrepancy between the visual
absolute magnitudes derived using the Hipparcos parallaxes and the BCD values
is on average 0.3 mag for He-weak stars, while it is 0.5 mag for He-strong
stars. For He-strong stars, we note that the BCD calibration, based on stars in
the solar environment, leads to overestimated values of Teff. By means of model
atmosphere calculations with enhanced He/H abundance ratios we show that larger
He/H ratios produce smaller BD which naturally explains the Teff
overestimation. We take advantage of these calculations to introduce a method
to estimate the He/H abundance ratio in He-strong stars. The BD of HD 37479
suggests that the Teff of this star remains fairly constant as the star
spectrum undergoes changes in the intensity of H and He absorption lines. Data
for the He-strong star HD 66765 are reported for the first time.

function starting from positive infinity. In this paper, we express the
Tracy-Widom distribution functions in terms of integrals starting from minus

The discrepancy in G-band contrast: Where is the quiet Sun?,"  We compare the rms contrast in observed speckle reconstructed G-band images
with synthetic filtergrams computed from two magneto-hydrodynamic simulation
snapshots. The observations consist of 103 bursts of 80 frames each taken at
the Dunn Solar Telescope (DST), sampled at twice the diffraction limit of the
telescope. The speckle reconstructions account for the performance of the
Adaptive Optics (AO) system at the DST to supply reliable photometry. We find a
considerable discrepancy in the observed rms contrast of 14.1% for the best
reconstructed images, and the synthetic rms contrast of 21.5% in a simulation
snapshot thought to be representative of the quiet Sun. The areas of features
in the synthetic filtergrams that have positive or negative contrast beyond the
minimum and maximum values in the reconstructed images have spatial scales that
should be resolved. This leads us to conclude that there are fundamental
differences in the rms G-band contrast between observed and computed

Fundamental Limits to Position Determination by Concentration Gradients,"  Position determination in biological systems is often achieved through
protein concentration gradients. Measuring the local concentration of such a
protein with a spatially-varying distribution allows the measurement of
position within the system. In order for these systems to work effectively,
position determination must be robust to noise. Here, we calculate fundamental
limits to the precision of position determination by concentration gradients
due to unavoidable biochemical noise perturbing the gradients. We focus on
gradient proteins with first order reaction kinetics. Systems of this type have
been experimentally characterised in both developmental and cell biology
settings. For a single gradient we show that, through time-averaging, great
precision can potentially be achieved even with very low protein copy numbers.
As a second example, we investigate the ability of a system with oppositely
directed gradients to find its centre. With this mechanism, positional
precision close to the centre improves more slowly with increasing averaging
time, and so longer averaging times or higher copy numbers are required for
high precision. For both single and double gradients, we demonstrate the
existence of optimal length scales for the gradients, where precision is
maximized, as well as analyzing how precision depends on the size of the
concentration measuring apparatus. Our results provide fundamental constraints
on the positional precision supplied by concentration gradients in various
contexts, including both in developmental biology and also within a single
cell.

Capacity Gain from Two-Transmitter and Two-Receiver Cooperation,"  Capacity improvement from transmitter and receiver cooperation is
investigated in a two-transmitter, two-receiver network with phase fading and
full channel state information available at all terminals. The transmitters
cooperate by first exchanging messages over an orthogonal transmitter
cooperation channel, then encoding jointly with dirty paper coding. The
receivers cooperate by using Wyner-Ziv compress-and-forward over an analogous
orthogonal receiver cooperation channel. To account for the cost of
cooperation, the allocation of network power and bandwidth among the data and
cooperation channels is studied. It is shown that transmitter cooperation
outperforms receiver cooperation and improves capacity over non-cooperative
transmission under most operating conditions when the cooperation channel is
strong. However, a weak cooperation channel limits the transmitter cooperation
rate; in this case receiver cooperation is more advantageous.
Transmitter-and-receiver cooperation offers sizable additional capacity gain

Quantile and Probability Curves Without Crossing,"  This paper proposes a method to address the longstanding problem of lack of
monotonicity in estimation of conditional and structural quantile functions,
also known as the quantile crossing problem. The method consists in sorting or

quantile curve in finite samples than the original curve, establish a
functional delta method for rearrangement-related operators, and derive
functional limit theory for the entire rearranged curve and its functionals. We
also establish validity of the bootstrap for estimating the limit law of the
the entire rearranged curve and its functionals. Our limit results are generic
in that they apply to every estimator of a monotone econometric function,
provided that the estimator satisfies a functional central limit theorem and
the function satisfies some smoothness conditions. Consequently, our results

from genuine quark-gluon processes. The predicted cross sections for Dbar-N for
excess energies up to 150 MeV are of the same order of magnitude as those for
KN but with average values of around 20 mb, roughly a factor two larger than

basically fixed by the assumed SU(4) symmetry, clearly determines the
qualitative features of the Dbar-N interaction -- very similiar to what happens

Dbar-N interaction from meson-exchange and quark-gluon dynamics,"The research paper titled ""Dbar-N interaction from meson-exchange and quark-gluon dynamics"" aims to investigate the interaction between the antideuteron (Dbar) and the nucleon (N) using two different theoretical approaches: meson-exchange and quark-gluon dynamics. The main objective is to understand the nature of the Dbar-N interaction and how it is influenced by the underlying quark-gluon dynamics.
The researchers used a combination of effective field theory and lattice QCD simulations to study the Dbar-N interaction. They found that the interaction is primarily driven by the exchange of mesons, such as pions and rho mesons, which mediate the strong force between the Dbar and N. However, they also found that the quark-gluon dynamics play an important role in shaping the interaction, particularly at short distances.
The study also revealed that the Dbar-N interaction is sensitive to the properties of the Dbar, such as its size and binding energy, which in turn depend on the properties of the underlying quark-gluon dynamics. This has important implications for the production and detection of antideuterons in high-energy experiments.
Overall, the paper provides valuable insights into the nature of the Dbar-N interaction and highlights the importance of considering both meson-exchange and quark-gluon dynamics in theoretical models of nuclear interactions.",True,1

Hamiltonian Graphs and the Traveling Salesman Problem,"  A new characterisation of Hamiltonian graphs using f-cutset matrix is

so called ordered weighted adjacency list for given weighted complete graph and
proceed to the main result of the paper, namely, the exact algorithm based on
utilisation of ordered weighted adjacency list and the simple properties that
any path or circuit must satisfy. This algorithm performs checking of

pairs) for circuits, chosen from ordered adjacency list in a well defined

First proper motions of thin dust filaments at the Galactic Center,"  Context: L'-band (3.8 micron) images of the Galactic Center show a large
number of thin filaments in the mini-spiral, located west of the mini-cavity
and along the inner edge of the Northern Arm. One possible mechanism that could
produce such structures is the interaction of a central wind with the
mini-spiral. Additionally, we identify similar features that appear to be
associated with stars. Aims: We present the first proper motion measurements of
the thin dust filaments observed in the central parsec around SgrA* and
investigate possible mechanisms that could be responsible for the observed
motions. Methods: The observations have been carried out using the NACO
adaptive optics system at the ESO VLT. The images have been transformed to a
common coordinate system and features of interest were extracted. Then a
cross-correlation technique could be performed in order to determine the
offsets between the features with respect to their position in the reference
epoch. Results: We derive the proper motions of a number of filaments and 2
cometary shaped dusty sources close (in projection) to SgrA*. We show that the
shape and the motion of the filaments does not agree with a purely Keplerian
motion of the gas in the potential of the supermassive black hole at the
position of SgrA*. Therefore, additional mechanisms must be responsible for
their formation and motion. We argue that the properties of the filaments are
probably related to an outflow from the disk of young mass-losing stars around
SgrA*. In part, the outflow may originate from the black hole itself. We also
present some evidence and theoretical considerations that the outflow may be
collimated.

HD97048: a closer look to the disk,"  Aims: Today, large ground-based instruments, like VISIR on the VLT, providing
diffraction-limited (about 0.3 arcsec) images in the mid-infrared where strong
PAH features appear enable us to see the flaring structure of the disks around
Herbig Ae stars.
  Although great progress has been made in modelling the disk with radiative
transfer models able to reproduce the spectral energy distribution (SED) of
Herbig Ae stars, the constraints brought by images have not been yet fully
exploited. Here, we are interested in checking if these new observational
imaging constraints can be accounted for by predictions based on existing
models of passive centrally irradiated hydrostatic disks made to fit the SEDs
of the Herbig Ae stars.
  Methods: The images taken by VISIR in the 8.6 and 11.3 microns aromatic
features reveal a large flaring disk around HD97048 inclined to the line of
sight. In order to analyse the spatial distribution of these data, we use a
disk model which includes the most up to date understanding of disk structure
and physics around Herbig Ae stars with grains in thermal equilibrium in
addition to transiently-heated PAHs.
  Results: We compare the observed spatial distribution of the PAH emission
feature and the adjacent continuum emission with predictions based on existing
full disk models. Both SED and spatial distribution are in very good agreement
with the model predictions for common disk parameters.
  Conclusions: We take the general agreement between observations and
predictions as a strong support for the physical pictures underlying our flared

studied in both the stationary and the dynamic regimes. The stationary
transonic solution is greatly sensitive to infinitesimal deviations in the
outer boundary condition, but the flow becomes transonic and stable, when its

pronounced for a fractal medium than what is it for a continuum. The dynamic
approach also shows that there is a remarkable closeness between an equation of

Flow instabilities of magnetic flux tubes II. Longitudinal flow,"  Flow-induced instabilities are relevant for the storage and dynamics of
magnetic fields in stellar convection zones and possibly also in other
astrophysical contexts. We continue the study started in the first paper of
this series by considering the stability properties of longitudinal flows along
magnetic flux tubes. A linear stability analysis was carried out to determine
criteria for the onset of instability in the framework of the approximation of
thin magnetic flux tubes. In the non-dissipative case, we find Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability for flow velocities exceeding a critical speed that depends on the
Alfv{\'e}n speed and on the ratio of the internal and external densities.
Inclusion of a friction term proportional to the relative transverse velocity
leads to a friction-driven instability connected with backward (or negative
energy) waves. We discuss the physical nature of this instability. In the case
of a stratified external medium, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and the
friction-driven instability can set in for flow speeds significantly lower than
the Alfv{\'e}n speed. Dissipative effects can excite flow-driven instability
below the thresholds for the Kelvin-Helmholtz and the undulatory (Parker-type)
instabilities. This may be important for magnetic flux storage in stellar
convection zones and for the stability of astrophysical jets.

significant softening but, in the first case the bulk modulus is mainly
dependent on the density, while in the mixed phase model it also strongly
depends on the temperature. We also show that the bulk modulus is not vanishing

"Shear-strain-induced Spatially Varying Super-lattice Structures on
  Graphite studied by STM","  We report on the Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) observation of linear
fringes together with spatially varying super-lattice structures on (0001)
graphite (HOPG) surface. The structure, present in a region of a layer bounded
by two straight carbon fibers, varies from a hexagonal lattice of 6nm
periodicity to nearly a square lattice of 13nm periodicity. It then changes
into a one-dimensional (1-D) fringe-like pattern before relaxing into a
pattern-free region. We attribute this surface structure to a shear strain
giving rise to a spatially varying rotation of the affected graphite layer
relative to the bulk substrate. We propose a simple method to understand these
moire patterns by looking at the fixed and rotated lattices in the Fourier
transformed k-space. Using this approach we can reproduce the spatially varying
2-D lattice as well as the 1-D fringes by simulation. The 1-D fringes are found
to result from a particular spatial dependence of the rotation angle.

"Efficient model chemistries for peptides. I. Split-valence Gaussian
  basis sets and the heterolevel approximation in RHF and MP2","  We present an exhaustive study of more than 250 ab initio potential energy
surfaces (PESs) of the model dipeptide HCO-L-Ala-NH2. The model chemistries
(MCs) used are constructed as homo- and heterolevels involving possibly
different RHF and MP2 calculations for the geometry and the energy. The basis
sets used belong to a sample of 39 selected representants from Pople's
split-valence families, ranging from the small 3-21G to the large
6-311++G(2df,2pd). The reference PES to which the rest are compared is the
MP2/6-311++G(2df,2pd) homolevel, which, as far as we are aware, is the more
accurate PES of a dipeptide in the literature. The aim of the study presented

and diffuse functions in the basis set, distinguishing between those placed at
1st-row atoms and those placed at hydrogens, as well as the effect of different
contraction and valence splitting schemes. On the other hand, the investigation
of the heterolevel assumption, which is defined here to be that which states
that heterolevel MCs are more efficient than homolevel MCs. The heterolevel
approximation is very commonly used in the literature, but it is seldom
checked. As far as we know, the only tests for peptides or related systems,
have been performed using a small number of conformers, and this is the first

"A Model of Late Long-Term Potentiation Simulates Aspects of Memory
  Maintenance","  Late long-term potentiation (L-LTP) appears essential for the formation of
long-term memory, with memories at least partly encoded by patterns of
strengthened synapses. How memories are preserved for months or years, despite
molecular turnover, is not well understood. Ongoing recurrent neuronal
activity, during memory recall or during sleep, has been hypothesized to
preferentially potentiate strong synapses, preserving memories. This hypothesis
has not been evaluated in the context of a mathematical model representing
biochemical pathways important for L-LTP. I incorporated ongoing activity into
two such models: a reduced model that represents some of the essential
biochemical processes, and a more detailed published model. The reduced model
represents synaptic tagging and gene induction intuitively, and the detailed
model adds activation of essential kinases by Ca. Ongoing activity was modeled
as continual brief elevations of [Ca]. In each model, two stable states of
synaptic weight resulted. Positive feedback between synaptic weight and the
amplitude of ongoing Ca transients underlies this bistability. A tetanic or
theta-burst stimulus switches a model synapse from a low weight to a high
weight stabilized by ongoing activity. Bistability was robust to parameter
variations. Simulations illustrated that prolonged decreased activity reset
synapses to low weights, suggesting a plausible forgetting mechanism. However,
episodic activity with shorter inactive intervals maintained strong synapses.
Both models support experimental predictions. Tests of these predictions are
expected to further understanding of how neuronal activity is coupled to
maintenance of synaptic strength.

"Consistency between renormalization group running of chiral operator and
  counting rule -- Case of chiral pion production operator --","  In nuclear chiral perturbation theory (ChPT), an operator is defined in a
space with a cutoff which may be varied within a certain range. The operator
runs as a result of the variation of the cutoff [renormalization group (RG)
running]. In order for ChPT to be useful, the operator should run in a way
consistent with the counting rule; that is, the running of chiral counter terms
have to be of natural size. We vary the cutoff using the Wilsonian
renormalization group (WRG) equation, and examine this consistency. As an
example, we study the s-wave pion production operator for NN\to d pi, derived
in ChPT. We demonstrate that the WRG running does not generate any
chiral-symmetry-violating (CSV) interaction, provided that we start with an
operator which does not contain a CSV term. We analytically show how the
counter terms are generated in the WRG running in case of the infinitesimal
cutoff reduction. Based on the analytic result, we argue a range of the cutoff
variation for which the running of the counter terms is of natural size. Then,
we numerically confirm this.

"Large Deviations for Partition Functions of Directed Polymers and Some

Identifying network communities with a high resolution,"  Community structure is an important property of complex networks. An
automatic discovery of such structure is a fundamental task in many
disciplines, including sociology, biology, engineering, and computer science.
Recently, several community discovery algorithms have been proposed based on
the optimization of a quantity called modularity (Q). However, the problem of
modularity optimization is NP-hard, and the existing approaches often suffer
from prohibitively long running time or poor quality. Furthermore, it has been
recently pointed out that algorithms based on optimizing Q will have a
resolution limit, i.e., communities below a certain scale may not be detected.
In this research, we first propose an efficient heuristic algorithm, Qcut,
which combines spectral graph partitioning and local search to optimize Q.
Using both synthetic and real networks, we show that Qcut can find higher
modularities and is more scalable than the existing algorithms. Furthermore,
using Qcut as an essential component, we propose a recursive algorithm, HQcut,
to solve the resolution limit problem. We show that HQcut can successfully
detect communities at a much finer scale and with a higher accuracy than the
existing algorithms. Finally, we apply Qcut and HQcut to study a
protein-protein interaction network, and show that the combination of the two
algorithms can reveal interesting biological results that may be otherwise

An Alternative Source for Dark Energy,"Abstract:
The nature of dark energy remains one of the most enigmatic and challenging problems in modern cosmology. The standard model of cosmology postulates that dark energy is a mysterious force that drives the accelerated expansion of the universe. However, this model remains incomplete and unsatisfactory, as it relies on an unconfirmed and puzzling assumption about the nature of dark energy. In this paper, we propose an alternative source for dark energy that may resolve some of the existing problems with the standard model. Specifically, we suggest that dark energy may arise from the quantum vacuum fluctuations of a new scalar field that interacts with matter and radiation. We show that this hypothesis is consistent with current observational data and may provide a more natural explanation for the observed acceleration of the universe. Our results suggest that further investigation into the properties and dynamics of this new scalar field could shed light on the fundamental nature of dark energy and the origin of cosmic acceleration.",True,1

Geometry-induced asymmetric diffusion,"  Past work has shown that ions can pass through a membrane more readily in one
direction than the other. We demonstrate here in a model and an experiment that
for a mixture of small and large particles such asymmetric diffusion can arise

deterministic simulation considers a two-dimensional gas of elastic disks of
two sizes diffusing through a membrane, and our laboratory experiment examines
the diffusion of glass beads of two sizes through a metal membrane. In both
experiment and simulation, the membrane is permeable only to the smaller
particles, and the asymmetric pores lead to an asymmetry in the diffusion rates
of these particles. The presence of even a small percentage of large particles
can clog a membrane, preventing passage of the small particles in one direction
while permitting free flow of the small particles in the other direction. The
purely geometric kinetic constraints may play a role in common biological

The widths of quarkonia in quark gluon plasma,"  Recent lattice calculations showed that the quarkonia will survive beyond the
phase transition temperature, and will dissolve at different temperatures
depending on the type of the quarkonium. In this work, we calculate the thermal

width above 1.4 Tc becomes larger than 100 to 250 MeV, depending on the
effective thermal masses of the quark and gluon, which we take between 400 to
600 MeV. Such a width corresponds to an effective dissociation cross section by
gluons between 1.5 to 3.5 mb and by quarks 1 to 2 mb at 1.4 Tc. However, at
similar temperatures, we find a much smaller thermal width and effective cross
section for the upsilon.

"Matrix Exponential-Based Closures for the Turbulent Subgrid-Scale Stress
  Tensor","  Two approaches for closing the turbulence subgrid-scale stress tensor in
terms of matrix exponentials are introduced and compared. The first approach is
based on a formal solution of the stress transport equation in which the
production terms can be integrated exactly in terms of matrix exponentials.
This formal solution of the subgrid-scale stress transport equation is shown to
be useful to explore special cases, such as the response to constant velocity
gradient, but neglecting pressure-strain correlations and diffusion effects.
The second approach is based on an Eulerian-Lagrangian change of variables,
combined with the assumption of isotropy for the conditionally averaged
Lagrangian velocity gradient tensor and with the `Recent Fluid Deformation'
(RFD) approximation. It is shown that both approaches lead to the same basic
closure in which the stress tensor is expressed as the product of the matrix
exponential of the resolved velocity gradient tensor multiplied by its
transpose. Short-time expansions of the matrix exponentials are shown to
provide an eddy-viscosity term and particular quadratic terms, and thus allow a
reinterpretation of traditional eddy-viscosity and nonlinear stress closures.
The basic feasibility of the matrix-exponential closure is illustrated by
implementing it successfully in Large Eddy Simulation of forced isotropic
turbulence. The matrix-exponential closure employs the drastic approximation of
entirely omitting the pressure-strain correlation and other `nonlinear
scrambling' terms. But unlike eddy-viscosity closures, the matrix exponential
approach provides a simple and local closure that can be derived directly from

The origin of the work function,"  In this paper we analyse the mechanisms responsible for the bonding of
electrons to metal surfaces. We present and validate a method to measure the
energy distribution of dense electron ensembles at ambient conditions. We have
found sharp structures in the energy distribution of charge confined at metal
surfaces. These structures correspond to the onset of space charge i.e.
electron emission. The threshold energy for emission increases linear with the
free electron density. We conclude that the work function is a direct measure
of the Hartree-Fock exchange energy. Remarkably, the emissions that have been
observed do not obey the Einstein-Millikan threshold relation for the photo
electric effect. By discrimination between requirements for energy and momentum
we deduce that electron emissions are trigged by photon momentum. We claim that
the photo electric effect is the result of a phase transition in an electron
gas that connects a surface bound, condensed state to a free continuum state.
The assignment of a phase transition to the effect under consideration is
justified by analyzing the behaviour of the Fermi-Dirac energy distribution

Modeling the Epps effect of cross correlations in asset prices,"  We review the decomposition method of stock return cross-correlations,
presented previously for studying the dependence of the correlation coefficient
on the resolution of data (Epps effect). Through a toy model of random
walk/Brownian motion and memoryless renewal process (i.e. Poisson point
process) of observation times we show that in case of analytical treatability,
by decomposing the correlations we get the exact result for the frequency
dependence. We also demonstrate that our approach produces reasonable fitting
of the dependence of correlations on the data resolution in case of empirical
data. Our results indicate that the Epps phenomenon is a product of the finite
time decay of lagged correlations of high resolution data, which does not scale
with activity. The characteristic time is due to a human time scale, the time
needed to react to news.

Are the most metal-poor galaxies young?,"  We review the possibility that metallicity could provide a diagnostic for the
age of a galaxy, hence that the most metal-poor star forming galaxies in the
local universe may be genuinely young. Indeed, observational evidence for
downsizing shows the average age of the stars in a galaxy to decrease with
decreasing mass and metallicity. However, we conclude both from observational
and theoretical viewpoints that metallicity is not an arrow of time.
Consequently the most metal poor galaxies of our local universe are not
necessarely young. Current observations suggest that an old stellar population
is present in all metal-poor galaxies, although a couple of cases, e.g. IZw18,
remain under debate. Further observations with more sentitive equipement should

Trapping mechanism in overdamped ratchets with quenched noise,"  A trapping mechanism is observed and proposed as the origin of the anomalous
behavior recently discovered in transport properties of overdamped ratchets
subject to external oscillatory drive in the presence of quenched noise. In
particular, this mechanism is shown to appear whenever the quenched disorder
strength is greater than a threshold value. The minimum disorder strength
required for the existence of traps is determined by studying the trap
structure in a disorder configuration space. An approximation to the trapping
probability density function in a disordered region of finite length included

We study the trapping mechanism, which refers to the phenomenon where particles get stuck in a potential well and fail to move. We use numerical simulations to analyze the effect of quenched noise on the trapping mechanism in overdamped ratchets.

Fluidization of a vertically oscillated shallow granular layer,"  Molecular dynamics simulations are used to study fluidization of a vertically

Direct imaging of lateral movements of AMPA receptors inside synapses,"  Trafficking of AMPA receptors in and out of synapses is crucial for synaptic

coincident with the UC HII regions in massive star forming regions are likely
to be tracing outflows and extremely young high mass stars before the onset of
the UC HII region phase. After a decade of groundwork supporting the hypothesis
that linarly distributed class II methanol masers may generally trace accretion
disks around young massive stars, compelling evidence is mounting that these

An abundance of invariant polynomials satisfying the Riemann hypothesis,"  In 1999, Iwan Duursma defined the zeta function for a linear code as a
generating function of its Hamming weight enumerator. It can also be defined
for other homogeneous polynomials not corresponding to existing codes. If the
homogeneous polynomial is invariant under the MacWilliams transform, then its
zeta function satisfies a functional equation and we can formulate an analogue
of the Riemann hypothesis. As far as existing codes are concerned, the Riemann
hypothesis is believed to be closely related to the extremal property.
  In this article, we show there are abundant polynomials invariant by the
MacWilliams transform which satisfy the Riemann hypothesis. The proof is
carried out by explicit construction of such polynomials. To prove the Riemann
hypothesis for a certain class of invariant polynomials, we establish an
analogue of the Enestr""om-Kakeya theorem.

Acyclic Preference Systems in P2P Networks,"  In this work we study preference systems natural for the Peer-to-Peer
paradigm. Most of them fall in three categories: global, symmetric and
complementary. All these systems share an acyclicity property. As a
consequence, they admit a stable (or Pareto efficient) configuration, where no
participant can collaborate with better partners than their current ones. We
analyze the representation of the such preference systems and show that any
acyclic system can be represented with a symmetric mark matrix. This gives a
method to merge acyclic preference systems and retain the acyclicity. We also
consider such properties of the corresponding collaboration graph, as
clustering coefficient and diameter. In particular, studying the example of
preferences based on real latency measurements, we observe that its stable
configuration is a small-world graph.

Ensemble Learning for Free with Evolutionary Algorithms ?,"  Evolutionary Learning proceeds by evolving a population of classifiers, from
which it generally returns (with some notable exceptions) the single
best-of-run classifier as final result. In the meanwhile, Ensemble Learning,
one of the most efficient approaches in supervised Machine Learning for the
last decade, proceeds by building a population of diverse classifiers. Ensemble
Learning with Evolutionary Computation thus receives increasing attention. The
Evolutionary Ensemble Learning (EEL) approach presented in this paper features
two contributions. First, a new fitness function, inspired by co-evolution and
enforcing the classifier diversity, is presented. Further, a new selection
criterion based on the classification margin is proposed. This criterion is
used to extract the classifier ensemble from the final population only

Area laws in quantum systems: mutual information and correlations,"  The holographic principle states that on a fundamental level the information
content of a region should depend on its surface area rather than on its
volume. This counterintuitive idea which has its roots in the nonextensive
nature of black-hole entropy serves as a guiding principle in the search for
the fundamental laws of Planck-scale physics. In this paper we show that a
similar phenomenon emerges from the established laws of classical and quantum
physics: the information contained in part of a system in thermal equilibrium
obeys an area law. While the maximal information per unit area depends
classically only on the number of microscopic degrees of freedom, it may
diverge as the inverse temperature in quantum systems. A rigorous relation

Cascading on extragalactic background light,"  High-energy gamma-rays propagating in the intergalactic medium can interact
with background infrared photons to produce e+e- pairs, resulting in the
absorption of the intrinsic gamma-ray spectrum. TeV observations of the distant
blazar 1ES 1101-232 were thus recently used to put an upper limit on the
infrared extragalactic background light density. The created pairs can
upscatter background photons to high energies, which in turn may pair produce,
thereby initiating a cascade. The pairs diffuse on the extragalactic magnetic
field (EMF) and cascade emission has been suggested as a means for measuring
its intensity. Limits on the IR background and EMF are reconsidered taking into
account cascade emissions. The cascade equations are solved numerically.
Assuming a power-law intrinsic spectrum, the observed 100 MeV - 100 TeV
spectrum is found as a function of the intrinsic spectral index and the
intensity of the EMF. Cascades emit mainly at or below 100 GeV. The observed
TeV spectrum appears softer than for pure absorption when cascade emission is
taken into account. The upper limit on the IR photon background is found to be
robust. Inversely, the intrinsic spectra needed to fit the TeV data are
uncomfortably hard when cascade emission makes a significant contribution to
the observed spectrum. An EMF intensity around 1e-8 nG leads to a
characteristic spectral hump in the GLAST band. Higher EMF intensities divert
the pairs away from the line-of-sight and the cascade contribution to the
spectrum becomes negligible.

NBODY meets stellar population - The HYDE-PARC Project,"  N-body simulations give us a rough idea of how the shape of a simulated
object appears in three-dimensional space. From an observational point of view
this may give us a misleading picture. The faint stars may be the most common
stars in the system but the morphological information obtained by observations
of an object may be dominated by the color properties of the bright stars. Due
to dynamical effects, such as energy equipartition, different masses of stars
may populate different regions in the object. Since stars are evolving in mass
the stellar evolution may also influence the dynamics of the system. Hence, if
one is interested in simulating what the morphology will look like through a
telescope, one needs to simulate in addition evolving stars and weight them by
their luminosity. Therefore we need to combine simulations of the dynamical
evolution and a stellar population synthesis at the same time. For the
dynamical evolution part we use a parallel version of a direct N-body code,
NBODY6++. This code also includes stellar evolution. We link the parameters
from this stellar evolution routine to the BaSeL 2.0 stellar library. For
isolated clusters we found results assimilable to standard stellar population
synthesis codes such as the PEGASE code. For clusters in a tidal field we found
that the integrated colors become relatively bluer due to energy equipartition
effects. In the time shortly before dissolution of the cluster the stellar M/L
ratio becomes lower compared to isolated clusters. We compared the results of
our simulations to integrated spectra of galactic globular clusters. For the
cluster NGC 1851 we found good agreement between simulation and observation.
For extragalactic clusters in M81 and M31 we looked at medium band spectral
energy distributions and found for some clusters also a good agreement.

"On over-reflection and generation of Gravito-Alfven waves in solar-type
  stars","  The dynamics of linear perturbations is studied in magnetized plasma shear
flows with a constant shearing rate and with gravity-induced stratification.
The general set of linearized equations is derived and the two-dimensional case
is considered in detail. The Boussinesq approximation is used in order to
examine relatively small-scale perturbations of low-frequency modes:
Gravito-Alfven waves (GAW) and Entropy Mode (EM) perturbations. It is shown
that for flows with arbitrary shearing rate there exists a finite time interval
of non-adiabatic evolution of the perturbations. The non-adiabatic behavior
manifests itself in a twofold way, viz. by the over-reflection of the GAWs and
by the generation of GAWs from EM perturbations. It is shown that these
phenomena act as efficient transformers of the equilibrium flow energy into the
energy of the perturbations for moderate and high shearing rate solar plasma
flows. Efficient generation of GAW by EM takes place for shearing rates about
an order of magnitude smaller than necessary for development of a shear
instability. The latter fact could have important consequences for the problem

"Unusual doping and temperature dependence of photoemission spectra from

"The KATRIN sensitivity to the neutrino mass and to right-handed currents
  in beta decay","  The aim of the KArlsruhe TRItium Neutrino experiment KATRIN is the
determination of the absolute neutrino mass scale down to 0.2 eV, with
essentially smaller model dependence than from cosmology and neutrinoless
double beta decay. For this purpose, the integral electron energy spectrum is
measured close to the endpoint of molecular tritium beta decay. The endpoint,
together with the neutrino mass, should be fitted from the KATRIN data as a
free parameter. The right-handed couplings change the electron energy spectrum
close to the endpoint, therefore they have some effect also to the precise
neutrino mass determination. The statistical calculations show that, using the
endpoint as a free parameter, the unaccounted right-handed couplings
constrained by many beta decay experiments can change the fitted neutrino mass
value, relative to the true neutrino mass, by not larger than about 5-10 %.
Using, incorrectly, the endpoint as a fixed input parameter, the above change
of the neutrino mass can be much larger, order of 100 %, and for some cases it
can happen that for large true neutrino mass value the fitted neutrino mass
squared is negative. Publications using fixed endpoint and presenting large

The Complexity of Model Checking Higher-Order Fixpoint Logic,"  Higher-Order Fixpoint Logic (HFL) is a hybrid of the simply typed
\lambda-calculus and the modal \lambda-calculus. This makes it a highly
expressive temporal logic that is capable of expressing various interesting
correctness properties of programs that are not expressible in the modal
\lambda-calculus.
  This paper provides complexity results for its model checking problem. In
particular we consider those fragments of HFL built by using only types of
bounded order k and arity m. We establish k-fold exponential time completeness
for model checking each such fragment. For the upper bound we use fixpoint
elimination to obtain reachability games that are singly-exponential in the
size of the formula and k-fold exponential in the size of the underlying
transition system. These games can be solved in deterministic linear time. As a
simple consequence, we obtain an exponential time upper bound on the expression
complexity of each such fragment.
  The lower bound is established by a reduction from the word problem for
alternating (k-1)-fold exponential space bounded Turing Machines. Since there
are fixed machines of that type whose word problems are already hard with
respect to k-fold exponential time, we obtain, as a corollary, k-fold
exponential time completeness for the data complexity of our fragments of HFL,
provided m exceeds 3. This also yields a hierarchy result in expressive power.

Dynamical friction force exerted on spherical bodies,"  We present a rigorous calculation of the dynamical friction force exerted on

Diversity of MIMO Multihop Relay Channels - Part I: Amplify-and-Forward,"  In this two-part paper, we consider the multiantenna multihop relay channels

which the relays simply scale the received signal and retransmit it. More
specifically, we characterize the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) of the

scheme has the same DMT as the AF scheme, while the PF can have significant
power gain over the AF scheme in some cases. In part II, we will derive the

"The solitons redistribution in Bose-Einstein condensate in quasiperiodic
  optical lattice","  We numerically study the dynamical excitations in Bose-Einstein condensate
(BEC) placed in periodic and quasi-periodic 2D optical lattice (OL). In case of
the repulsive mean-field interaction the BEC quantum tunnelling leads to a
progressive soliton's splitting and generating of secondary solitons, which
migrate to closest trapping potential minima. A nontrivial soliton dynamics
appears when a series of pi-pulses (phase kicks) are applied to the optical

secondary solitons, leading to a formation of an artificial solitonic
superlattice. Different geometries of OL are analyzed.

Strongly Interacting Higgs Sector Without Technicolor,"  Several years ago, we proposed a modification of the Standard Model, in which
the Higgs sector was stabilized by the addition of higher derivative operators,
similar to Lee-Wick Electrodynamics. We studied this theory extensively, both
using continuum Hamiltonian and path integral methods. We also reported
detailed lattice studies of the higher derivative Higgs sector. In view of some
recent revived interest in our original idea, we are providing here our
extensive notes from the time period on this topic. The key results were
already published in our papers at that time. The many additional details that
we make available here were previously available only in Chuan Liu's UCSD Ph.D.

Warping and Supersymmetry Breaking,"  We analyze supersymmetry breaking by anti-self-dual flux in the deformed
conifold. This theory has been argued to be a dual realization of susy breaking
by antibranes. As such, one might expect it to lead to a hierarchically small
breaking scale, but only if the warp factor is taken into account. We verify
this by explicitly computing the warp-modified moduli space metric. This leads
to a new term, with a power-like divergence at the conifold point, which lowers
the breaking scale. We finally point out various puzzles regarding the gauge
theory interpretation of these results.

"On constraining a transiting exoplanet's rotation rate with its transit
  spectrum","  We investigate the effect of planetary rotation on the transit spectrum of an
extrasolar giant planet. During ingress and egress, absorption features arising
from the planet's atmosphere are Doppler shifted by of order the planet's
rotational velocity (~1-2 km/s) relative to where they would be if the planet
were not rotating. We focus in particular on the case of HD209458b, which ought
to be at least as good a target as any other known transiting planet. For
HD209458b, this shift should give rise to a small net centroid shift of ~60
cm/s on the stellar absorption lines. Using a detailed model of the
transmission spectrum due to a rotating star transited by a rotating planet
with an isothermal atmosphere, we simulate the effect of the planet's rotation
on the shape of the spectral lines, and in particular on the magnitude of their
width and centroid shift. We then use this simulation to determine the expected
signal-to-noise ratio for distinguishing a rotating from a non-rotating planet,
and assess how this S/N scales with various parameters of HD209458b. We find
that with a 6 m telescope, an equatorial rotational velocity of ~2 km/s could
be detected with a S/N~5 by accumulating the signal over many transits over the
course of several years. With a 30 m telescope, the time required to make such
a detection reduces to less than 2 months.

"On constraining a transiting exoplanet's rotation rate with its transit
  spectrum","The research paper titled ""On Constraining a Transiting Exoplanet's Rotation Rate with its Transit Spectrum"" aimed to investigate the possibility of using the transit spectrum of a transiting exoplanet to constrain its rotation rate. The authors used a model that takes into account the effects of the planet's rotation on its atmospheric circulation and transit spectrum.

with finite three velocity smaller than the speed of light even at the event
horizon or inside the horizon, and the angular velocities of the accretion flow

To achieve this, we perform numerical simulations using a general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics code. Our results show that the black hole spin affects the size and shape of the accretion disk, as well as the accretion rate and the energy output. We find that the presence of a rotating black hole can generate strong jets and outflows, which can have important astrophysical implications.

A simple one dimensional glassy Kac model,"  We define a new family of random spin models with one-dimensional structure,
finite-range multi-spin interactions, and bounded average degree (number of

allowing for efficient numerical analysis.
  In the limit of infinite interaction range, we recover the so-called XORSAT

transition as the average degree is increased. Here we investigate the most
important consequences of a large but finite interaction range: (i)
Fluctuation-induced corrections to thermodynamic quantities; (ii) The need of

Fifteen Years of High-Resolution Radio Imaging of Supernova 1987A,"  Supernova 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud provides a spectacularly
detailed view of the aftermath of a core-collapse explosion. The supernova
ejecta initially coasted outward at more than 10% of the speed of light, but in
1990 were observed to decelerate rapidly as they began to encounter dense
circumstellar material expelled by the progenitor star. The resulting shock has
subsequently produced steadily brightening radio synchrotron emission, which is
resolved by the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) into an expanding
limb-brightened shell. Here we present 15 years of ATCA imaging of Supernova
1987A, at an effective angular resolution of 0.4 arcsec. We find that the radio
remnant has accelerated in its expansion over this period, from approx 3600
km/s in 1992 to approx 5200 km/s at the end of 2006. The published diameters of
the evolving X-ray shell have been ~15% smaller than the corresponding radio
values, but a simultaneous Fourier analysis of both radio and X-ray data
eliminates this discrepancy, and yields a current diameter for the shell in
both wave-bands of approx 1.7 arcsec. An asymmetric brightness distribution is
seen in radio images at all ATCA epochs: the eastern and western rims have
higher fluxes than the northern and southern regions, indicating that most of
the radio emission comes from the equatorial plane of the system, where the
progenitor star's circumstellar wind is thought to be densest. The eastern lobe
is brighter than and further from the supernova site than the western lobe,
suggesting an additional asymmetry in the initial distribution of supernova
ejecta.

Exact Floquet states of a driven condensate and their stabilities,"  We investigate the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for a classically chaotic
system, which describes an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate confined in an
optical lattice and driven by a spatiotemporal periodic laser field. It is
demonstrated that the exact Floquet states appear when the external
time-dependent potential is balanced by the nonlinear mean-field interaction.
The balance region of parameters is divided into a phase-continuing region and
a phase-jumping one. In the latter region, the Floquet states are
spatiotemporal vortices of nontrivial phase structures and zero-density cores.
Due to the velocity singularities of vortex cores and the blowing-up of
perturbed solutions, the spatiotemporal vortices are unstable periodic states
embedded in chaos. The stability and instability of these Floquet states are
numerically explored by the time evolution of fidelity between the exact and
numerical solutions. It is numerically illustrated that the stable Floquet

MICS Asia Phase II - Sensitivity to the aerosol module,"  In the framework of the model inter-comparison study - Asia Phase II (MICS2),
where eight models are compared over East Asia, this paper studies the
influence of different parameterizations used in the aerosol module on the
aerosol concentrations of sulfate and nitrate in PM10. An intracomparison of
aerosol concentrations is done for March 2001 using different configurations of
the aerosol module of one of the model used for the intercomparison. Single
modifications of a reference setup for model configurations are performed and
compared to a reference case. These modifications concern the size
distribution, i.e. the number of sections, and physical processes, i.e.
coagulation, condensation/evaporation, cloud chemistry, heterogeneous reactions

found that sulfate concentrations are little sensitive to sea-salt emissions
and to whether condensation is computed dynamically or by assuming
thermodynamic equilibrium. Nitrate concentrations are little sensitive to cloud
chemistry. However, a very high sensitivity to heterogeneous reactions is
observed. Thereafter, the variability of the aerosol concentrations to the use
of different chemistry transport models (CTMs) and the variability to the use
of different parameterizations in the aerosol module are compared. For sulfate,
the variability to the use of different parameterizations in the aerosol module
is lower than the variability to the use of different CTMs. However, for

Particle Interpretations of the PVLAS Data,"  Recently the PVLAS collaboration reported the observation of a rotation of
linearly polarized laser light induced by a transverse magnetic field -- a
signal being unexpected within standard QED. In this review, we emphasize two
mechanisms which have been proposed to explain this result: production of a
single light neutral spin-zero particle or pair production of light minicharged
particles. We discuss a class of models, involving, in addition to our familiar
``visible'' photon, further light ``hidden paraphotons'', which mix
kinematically with the visible one, and further light paracharged particles. In
these models, very strong astrophysical and cosmological bounds on the weakly
interacting light particles mentioned above can be evaded. In the upcoming
year, a number of decisive laboratory based tests of the particle
interpretation of the PVLAS anomaly will be done. More generally, such
experiments, exploiting high fluxes of low-energy photons and/or large
electromagnetic fields, will dig into previously unconstrained parameter space
of the above mentioned models.

Particle Interpretations of the PVLAS Data,"Particle Interpretations of the PVLAS Data: Abstract
The PVLAS (Polarizzazione del Vuoto con Laser) experiment has provided intriguing results regarding the interaction of light with a magnetic field in a vacuum. The experiment has measured a rotation of the plane of polarization of a laser beam passing through a strong magnetic field in a vacuum, in contrast to the prediction of classical electrodynamics. The observed rotation has been interpreted as a manifestation of the production of light particles, such as axions or paraphotons, in the magnetic field. This paper reviews the experimental results and the theoretical interpretations of the PVLAS data, focusing on the particle interpretations. We discuss the properties of the hypothetical particles that could explain the observed effect, the constraints imposed by other experiments and observations, and the prospects for future tests of the particle interpretation. We also address some of the controversies and debates surrounding the interpretation of the PVLAS data, such as the role of other effects, the sensitivity of the experiment to systematic uncertainties, and the compatibility with other theoretical models. Our analysis suggests that the particle interpretations of the PVLAS data remain a viable and exciting possibility for the explanation of the observed effect, but further experimental and theoretical investigations are needed to confirm or refute this hypothesis.",True,1

"Generalized Stability Condition for Generalized and Doubly-Generalized
  LDPC Codes","  In this paper, the stability condition for low-density parity-check (LDPC)

Renormalization and Effective Actions for General Relativity,"  Quantum gravity is analyzed from the viewpoint of the renormalization group.
The analysis is based on methods introduced by J. Polchinski concerning the
perturbative renormalization with flow equations. In the first part of this
work, the program of renormalization with flow equations is reviewed and then
extended to effective field theories that have a finite UV cutoff. This is done
for a scalar field theory by imposing additional renormalization conditions for
some of the nonrenormalizable couplings. It turns out that one so obtains a
statement on the predictivity of the effective theory at scales far below the
UV cutoff. In particular, nonrenormalizable theories can be treated without
problems in the proposed framework. In the second part, the standard covariant
BRS quantization program for Euclidean Einstein gravity is applied. A momentum
cutoff regularization is imposed and the resulting violation of the
Slavnov-Taylor identities is discussed. Deriving Polchinski's renormalization
group equation for Euclidean quantum gravity, the predictivity of effective
quantum gravity at scales far below the Planck scale is investigated with flow
equations. A fine-tuning procedure for restoring the violated Slavnov-Taylor
identities is proposed and it is argued that in the effective quantum gravity
context, the restoration will only be accomplished with finite accuracy.
Finally, the no-cutoff limit of Euclidean quantum gravity is analyzed from the
viewpoint of the Polchinski method. It is speculated whether a limit with
nonvanishing gravitational constant might exist where the latter would
ultimatively be determined by the cosmological constant and the masses of the
elementary particles.

Renormalization and Effective Actions for General Relativity,"The research paper titled ""Renormalization and Effective Actions for General Relativity"" focuses on the concept of renormalization in the context of general relativity. The authors explore the use of effective actions to describe the dynamics of gravity and the quantization of the gravitational field. They develop a systematic renormalization procedure for the effective action, which allows for the calculation of physical observables in a way that is consistent with the principles of quantum field theory.
The paper presents several key results and conclusions. One important result is the derivation of the renormalization group equation for the effective action, which describes how the effective action changes as the energy scale of the system is varied. The authors show that this equation can be used to derive the beta function for the gravitational coupling constant, which is a crucial parameter in the theory of gravity.
Another key result is the calculation of the effective action for a non-minimally coupled scalar field in curved spacetime. The authors show that the effective action can be written in terms of a series of curvature invariants, which provides a useful tool for analyzing the behavior of the scalar field in the presence of gravity.
Overall, the paper provides a comprehensive overview of the use of renormalization and effective actions in the context of general relativity.

"ECHO: an Eulerian Conservative High Order scheme for general
  relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and magnetodynamics","  We present a new numerical code, ECHO, based on an Eulerian Conservative High
Order scheme for time dependent three-dimensional general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) and magnetodynamics (GRMD). ECHO is aimed at
providing a shock-capturing conservative method able to work at an arbitrary
level of formal accuracy (for smooth flows), where the other existing GRMHD and
GRMD schemes yield an overall second order at most. Moreover, our goal is to
present a general framework, based on the 3+1 Eulerian formalism, allowing for
different sets of equations, different algorithms, and working in a generic
space-time metric, so that ECHO may be easily coupled to any solver for
Einstein's equations. Various high order reconstruction methods are implemented
and a two-wave approximate Riemann solver is used. The induction equation is
treated by adopting the Upwind Constrained Transport (UCT) procedures,
appropriate to preserve the divergence-free condition of the magnetic field in
shock-capturing methods. The limiting case of magnetodynamics (also known as
force-free degenerate electrodynamics) is implemented by simply replacing the
fluid velocity with the electromagnetic drift velocity and by neglecting the
matter contribution to the stress tensor. ECHO is particularly accurate,
efficient, versatile, and robust. It has been tested against several
astrophysical applications, including a novel test on the propagation of large
amplitude circularly polarized Alfven waves. In particular, we show that

providing sharp profiles in tests involving discontinuities.

faithfully on the irreducible components of the moduli space of smooth surfaces
(of general type, canonically polarized). Bauer, Catanese, and Grunewald have
recently answered Catanese's original question using a different construction.

The Phase Structure of the Polyakov--Quark-Meson Model,"  The relation between the deconfinement and chiral phase transition is
explored in the framework of an Polyakov-loop-extended two-flavor quark-meson
(PQM) model. In this model the Polyakov loop dynamics is represented by a
background temporal gauge field which also couples to the quarks. As a novelty
an explicit quark chemical potential and N_f-dependence in the Polyakov loop
potential is proposed by using renormalization group arguments. The behavior of
the Polyakov loop as well as the chiral condensate as function of temperature
and quark chemical potential is obtained by minimizing the grand canonical
thermodynamic potential of the system. The effect of the Polyakov loop dynamics
on the chiral phase diagram and on several thermodynamic bulk quantities is
presented.

The Phase Structure of the Polyakov--Quark-Meson Model,"The research paper titled ""The Phase Structure of the Polyakov--Quark-Meson Model"" aims to investigate the phase structure of the Polyakov–Quark–Meson (PQM) model, a theoretical framework for studying the properties of strongly interacting matter. The study uses a combination of mean-field approximation and numerical simulations to analyze the phase diagram of the PQM model. 
The key finding of the study is that the PQM model exhibits a rich phase structure with several distinct phases, including a chiral symmetry broken phase, a deconfinement phase, and a mixed phase. The researchers also found that the model predicts a critical endpoint in the phase diagram, which is a point where the first-order phase transition terminates and becomes a second-order phase transition. 
Overall, the research provides new insights into the phase structure of the PQM model and sheds light on the properties of strongly interacting matter in extreme conditions, such as those found in the early universe or in heavy-ion collisions.",True,1
"A ""diamond-ring"" star: the unusual morphologic structure of a young
  (multiple?) object","  We have observed IRAS06468-0325 obtaining optical and infrared images through
IJHKs and L' filters, K-band low-resolution spectroscopy, together with
millimetre line observations of CO and CS. IRAS06468-0325 has a very unusual
and enigmatic morphology with two components: a bright, close to point-like
source (the diamond) and a sharp-edge ring-like structure (the ring). The
source is not detected in the optical, at wavelengths shorter than the I-band.
The diamond is seen in all the imaging bands observed. The ring-like structure
in IRAS06468-0325 is clearly seen in the I, J, H, and Ks. It is not detected in
the L'-band image. Infrared colours of the diamond are compatible with excess
circumstellar emission and a young stellar nature. A strongly non-gaussian and
moderately bright CO(1-0) and {13}CO(2-1) lines are seen towards
IRAS06468-0325, at v_{LSR} of 30.5 km s{-1} (corresponding to a kinematic
distance of 3 kpc). Very weak C{18}O(2-1) and CS(2-1) lines were detected.
K-band spectra of the diamond and of the ring are similar both in the slope of
the continuum and in the presence of lines supporting the idea that the ring is
reflected light from the diamond. With the current data, a few different
scenarios are possible to explain the morphology of this object. However, the
available data seem to favour that the morphology of IRAS06468-0325 correspond
to a young stellar multiple system in a transient stage where a binary
co-exists with a circumbinary disc, similar to the case of GG Tau. In this
case, the sharpness of the well-defined ring may be due to tidal truncation
from dynamic interactions between components in a binary or multiple stellar
system. IRAS06468-0325 may be an important rare case that illustrates a
short-lived stage of the process of binary or multiple star formation.

"Millimeter dust continuum emission unveiling the true mass of giant
  molecular clouds in the Small Magellanic Cloud","  CO observations have been so far the best way to trace molecular gas in
external galaxies, but at low metallicity the gas mass deduced could be largely
underestimated. At present, the kinematic information of CO data cubes are used
to estimate virial masses and trace the total mass of the molecular clouds.
Millimeter dust emission can also be used as a dense gas tracer and could
unveil H2 envelopes lacking CO. These different tracers must be compared in
different environments. This study compares virial masses to masses deduced
from millimeter emission, in two GMC samples: the local molecular clouds in our
Galaxy and their equivalents in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), one of the
nearest low metallicity dwarf galaxy. In our Galaxy, mass estimates deduced
from millimeter emission are consistent with masses deduced from gamma ray
analysis and trace the total mass of the clouds. Virial masses are
systematically larger (twice on average) than mass estimates from millimeter
dust emission. This difference decreases toward high masses and has already
been reported in previous studies. In the SMC however, molecular cloud masses
deduced from SIMBA millimeter observations are systematically higher (twice on
average for conservative values of the dust to gas ratio and dust emissivity)
than the virial masses from SEST CO observations. The observed excess can not
be accounted for by any plausible change of dust properties. Taking a general
form for the virial theorem, we show that a magnetic field strength of ~15
micro Gauss in SMC clouds could provide additional support to the clouds and
explain the difference observed. Masses of SMC molecular clouds have therefore
been underestimated so far. Magnetic pressure may contribute significantly to
their support.

The main objective of the paper is to investigate the behavior of tachyons under superluminal boosts, which are transformations that involve velocities greater than the speed of light. 
The paper presents a theoretical framework for understanding the properties of tachyons, including their energy-momentum relation and their behavior under Lorentz transformations. The authors then analyze the effects of superluminal boosts on tachyons, showing that these boosts can lead to a breakdown of causality and other paradoxical effects.
One of the significant conclusions of the paper is that tachyons may not be physically realizable due to the difficulties in reconciling their properties with the laws of physics. The authors also suggest that the study of tachyons and superluminal boosts could provide insights into the nature of spacetime and the fundamental laws of the universe.
Overall, the paper contributes to the ongoing exploration of the theoretical foundations of modern physics and highlights the challenges and opportunities associated with the study of tachyons and other exotic particles.",True,1
Un-renormalized Classical Electromagnetism,"  This paper follows in the tradition of direct-action versions of
electromagnetism having the aim of avoiding a balance of infinities wherein a
mechanical mass offsets an infinite electromagnetic mass so as to arrive at a
finite observed value. Given that, in this respect the direct-action approached
ultimately failed because its initial exclusion of self-action was found to be
untenable in the relativistic domain, this paper continues the tradition
considering instead a version of electromagnetism wherein mechanical action is
excluded and self-action is retained. It is shown that the resulting theory is
effectively interacting due to the presence of infinite forces. A vehicle for
the investigation is a pair of classical point charges in a positronium-like
arrangement for which the orbits are found to be self-sustaining and naturally
quantized.

Reduced bias nonparametric lifetime density and hazard estimation,"  Kernel-based nonparametric hazard rate estimation is considered with a
special class of infinite-order kernels that achieves favorable bias and mean
square error properties. A fully automatic and adaptive implementation of a
density and hazard rate estimator is proposed for randomly right censored data.
Careful selection of the bandwidth in the proposed estimators yields estimates
that are more efficient in terms of overall mean squared error performance, and
in some cases achieves a nearly parametric convergence rate. Additionally,
rapidly converging bandwidth estimates are presented for use in second-order
kernels to supplement such kernel-based methods in hazard rate estimation.
Simulations illustrate the improved accuracy of the proposed estimator against
other nonparametric estimators of the density and hazard function. A real data
application is also presented on survival data from 13,166 breast carcinoma
patients.

"Production of TeV gamma-radiation in the vicinity of the supermassive
  black hole in the giant radiogalaxy M87","  Although the giant radiogalaxy M 87 harbors many distinct regions of
broad-band nonthermal emission, the recently reported fast variability of TeV
gamma rays from M 87 on a timescale of days strongly constrains the range of
speculations concerning the possible sites and scenarios of particle
acceleration responsible for the observed TeV emission. A natural production
site of this radiation is the immediate vicinity of the central supermassive
mass black hole (BH). Because of the low bolometric luminosity, the nucleus of
M 87 is effectively transparent for gamma rays up to energy of 10 TeV, which
makes this source an ideal laboratory for study of particle acceleration
processes close to the BH event horizon. We critically analyse different
possible radiation mechanisms in this region, and argue that the observed very
high-energy gamma ray emission can be explained by the inverse Compton emission
of ultrarelativistic electron-positron pairs produced through the development
of an electromagnetic cascade in the BH magnetosphere. We demonstrate, through
detailed numerical calculations of acceleration and radiation of electrons in
the magnetospheric vacuum gap, that this ``pulsar magnetosphere like'' scenario
can satisfactorily explain the main properties of TeV gamma-ray emission of M
87.

Inflationary Cosmology Connecting Dark Energy and Dark Matter,"  Kination dominated quintessence models of dark energy have the intriguing
feature that the relic abundance of thermal cold dark matter can be
significantly enhanced compared to the predictions from standard cosmology.
Previous treatments of such models do not include a realistic embedding of
inflationary initial conditions. We remedy this situation by constructing a
viable inflationary model in which the inflaton and quintessence field are the
same scalar degree of freedom. Kination domination is achieved after inflation
through a strong push or ""kick"" of the inflaton, and sufficient reheating can
be achieved depending on model parameters. This allows us to explore both
model-dependent and model-independent cosmological predictions of this
scenario. We find that measurements of the B-mode CMB polarization can rule out
this class of scenarios almost model independently. We also discuss other
experimentally accessible signatures for this class of models.

Inflationary Cosmology Connecting Dark Energy and Dark Matter,"Abstract:
Inflationary cosmology proposes that the early universe underwent a period of exponential expansion, which can explain the observed uniformity and flatness of the universe. However, it also predicts the existence of dark energy and dark matter, two mysterious components that dominate the energy budget of the universe. This paper explores the connection between inflationary cosmology, dark energy, and dark matter, and how they are linked through the physics of the early universe. We review the current observations and theoretical models of dark energy and dark matter, and examine how they fit into the broader framework of inflationary cosmology. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities for testing these ideas through cosmological observations and experiments. Our analysis suggests that inflationary cosmology provides a compelling framework for understanding the origin and evolution of the universe, and that the study of dark energy and dark matter can shed light on the fundamental physics of the early universe.",True,1
Milnor Invariants for Spatial Graphs,"  Link homotopy has been an active area of research for knot theorists since
its introduction by Milnor in the 1950s. We introduce a new equivalence
relation on spatial graphs called component homotopy, which reduces to link
homotopy in the classical case. Unlike previous attempts at generalizing link
homotopy to spatial graphs, our new relation allows analogues of some standard
link homotopy results and invariants.
  In particular we can define a type of Milnor group for a spatial graph under
component homotopy, and this group determines whether or not the spatial graph
is splittable. More surprisingly, we will also show that whether the spatial
graph is splittable up to component homotopy depends only on the link homotopy
class of the links contained within it. Numerical invariants of the relation
will also be produced.

"Coalition Games with Cooperative Transmission: A Cure for the Curse of
  Boundary Nodes in Selfish Packet-Forwarding Wireless Networks","  In wireless packet-forwarding networks with selfish nodes, applications of a
repeated game can induce the nodes to forward each others' packets, so that the
network performance can be improved. However, the nodes on the boundary of such
networks cannot benefit from this strategy, as the other nodes do not depend on
them. This problem is sometimes known as the curse of the boundary nodes. To
overcome this problem, an approach based on coalition games is proposed, in
which the boundary nodes can use cooperative transmission to help the backbone
nodes in the middle of the network. In return, the backbone nodes are willing
to forward the boundary nodes' packets. The stability of the coalitions is
studied using the concept of a core. Then two types of fairness, namely, the
min-max fairness using nucleolus and the average fairness using the Shapley
function are investigated. Finally, a protocol is designed using both repeated
games and coalition games. Simulation results show how boundary nodes and
backbone nodes form coalitions together according to different fairness
criteria. The proposed protocol can improve the network connectivity by about

Looking beyond the horizon,"  In this short talk we review our results from the paper hep-th/0604075 with
the main stress on the issues of causality and acoustic metric in eikonal
approximation. In addition we correct the formula for the redshift of sound
signals from our original work. We show that, if there exists a special kind of
Born-Infeld type scalar field, then one can send information from inside a
black hole. This information is encoded in perturbations of the field
propagating in non-trivial scalar field backgrounds, which serve as a ""new
ether"". Although the action of the theory is manifestly Lorentz-invariant the
non-trivial solutions break this symmetry spontaneously, allowing, the
superluminal propagation of perturbations with respect to this ""new ether"". We
found the stationary solution for background, which describes the accretion of
the scalar field onto a black hole. Examining the propagation of small
perturbations around this solution we show that the signals emitted inside the
Schwarzschild horizon can reach an observer located outside the black hole.
Thus the accreting field forms a hydrodynamical analog of a black hole whose
horizon is inside of the gravitational black hole drawing in the scalar field.

A generic mechanism for adaptive growth rate regulation,"  How can a microorganism adapt to a variety of environmental conditions
despite there exists a limited number of signal transduction machineries? We
show that for any growing cells whose gene expression is under stochastic
fluctuations, adaptive cellular state is inevitably selected by noise, even
without specific signal transduction network for it. In general, changes in
protein concentration in a cell are given by its synthesis minus dilution and
degradation, both of which are proportional to the rate of cell growth. In an
adaptive state with a higher growth speed, both terms are large and balanced.
Under the presence of noise in gene expression, the adaptive state is less
affected by stochasticity since both the synthesis and dilution terms are
large, while for a non-adaptive state both the terms are smaller so that cells
are easily kicked out of the original state by noise. Hence, escape time from a
cellular state and the cellular growth rate are negatively correlated. This
leads to a selection of adaptive states with higher growth rates, and model
simulations confirm this selection to take place in general. The results
suggest a general form of adaptation that has never been brought to light - a
process that requires no specific machineries for sensory adaptation. The
present scheme may help explain a wide range of cellular adaptive responses

A generic mechanism for adaptive growth rate regulation,"This research paper proposes a generic mechanism for adaptive growth rate regulation that can be applied to a variety of organisms.

The authors conclude that this mechanism may be a fundamental aspect of growth regulation in all organisms and could be targeted for therapeutic interventions in diseases such as cancer.",True,1
"Using force covariance to derive effective stochastic interactions in
  dissipative particle dynamics","  There exist methods for determining effective conservative interactions in
coarse grained particle based mesoscopic simulations. The resulting models can
be used to capture thermal equilibrium behavior, but in the model system we
study do not correctly represent transport properties. In this article we
suggest the use of force covariance to determine the full functional form of
dissipative and stochastic interactions. We show that a combination of the
radial distribution function and a force covariance function can be used to
determine all interactions in dissipative particle dynamics. Furthermore we use
the method to test if the effective interactions in dissipative particle
dynamics (DPD) can be adjusted to produce a force covariance consistent with a
projection of a microscopic Lennard-Jones simulation. The results indicate that
the DPD ansatz may not be consistent with the underlying microscopic dynamics.
We discuss how this result relates to theoretical studies reported in the

"Light nuclei in galactic globular clusters : constraints on the
  self-enrichment scenario from nucleosynthesis","  Hydrogen-burning is the root cause of the star-to-star abundance variations
of light nuclei in Galactic globular clusters (GC). In the present work we
constrain the physical conditions that gave rise to the observed abundance
patterns of Li, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, as well as Mg isotopes in the typical case
of NGC6752. We perform nucleosynthesis calculations at constant temperature,
adopting realistic initial abundances for the proto-cluster gas. We use a
detailed nuclear reaction network and state-of-the-art nuclear reaction rates.
Although simplistic, our analysis provides original results and new constraints
on the self-enrichment scenario for GCs. Our parametrized calculations allow us
to determine a narrow range of temperature where the observed extreme
abundances of all light elements and isotopes in NGC6752 are nicely reproduced
simultaneously. This agreement is obtained after mixing of the H-processed
material with 30 % of unprocessed gas. The observed C-N, O-Na, Mg-Al, Li-Na and
F-Na anticorrelations, as well as the behaviour of the Mg isotopes can be
recovered by assuming mixing with even larger dilution factors. Li production
by the stars that build up the other abundance anomalies is not mandatory in
the case of NGC 6752. Observations of O, Na, Mg and Al constrain the
temperature range for H-burning; such temperatures are encountered in the two
main candidate ``polluters'' proposed for GCs, namely massive AGBs and the most
massive main-sequence stars. (Abridged).

double main sequence turn-off in this object. Despite this, the main sequence,
sub-giant branch, and red giant branch are all narrow and well-defined, and the
red clump is compact. We examine the spatial distribution of turn-off stars and
demonstrate that all belong to NGC 1846 rather than to any field star
population. In addition, the spatial distributions of the two sets of turn-off
stars may exhibit different central concentrations and some asymmetries. By
fitting isochrones, we show that the properties of the colour-magnitude diagram

abundance in NGC 1846, differing in age by approximately 300 Myr. The absolute
ages of the two populations are ~1.9 and ~2.2 Gyr, although there may be a

inferred from isochrone fitting is [M/H] ~ -0.40, consistent with spectroscopic

be explained if this object originated via the tidal capture of two star
clusters formed separately in a star cluster group in a single giant molecular
cloud. This scenario accounts naturally for the age difference and uniform

"Effect of selection on ancestry: an exactly soluble case and its

recently emerged as communication techniques that can make effective use of
collaborative/cooperative nodes to create a virtual

a linear programming problem, while for other general networks, the cost for
routing is dynamically adjusted according to the amount of energy remaining and

only a hot X-ray emitting accretion flow oscillates, while the cold disc is
absent at the QPO radius. We find that the QPO spectra are generally similar to
the spectrum of radiation emitted at the QPO radius, and they are broadened by
the relativistic effects. In particular, the QPO spectrum contains the disc
component in the oscillating disc with a corona scenario. We also review the
available data on energy dependencies of high frequency QPO, and we point out
that they appear to lack the disc component in their energy spectra. This would

A New Proof of Pappus's Theorem,"  Any stretching of Ringel's non-Pappus pseudoline arrangement when projected
into the Euclidean plane, implicitly contains a particular arrangement of nine
triangles. This arrangement has a complex constraint involving the sines of its
angles. These constraints cannot be satisfied by any projection of the initial
arrangement. This is sufficient to prove Pappus's theorem. The derivation of
the constraint is via systems of inequalities arising from the polar
coordinates of the lines. These systems are linear in r for any given theta,
and their solubility can be analysed in terms of the signs of determinants. The
evaluation of the determinants is via a normal form for sums of products of
sines, giving a powerful system of trigonometric identities. The particular
result is generalized to arrangements derived from three edge connected totally
cyclic directed graphs, conjectured to be sufficient for a complete analysis of
angle constraining arrangements of lines, and thus a full response to Ringel's
slope conjecture. These methods are generally applicable to the realizability
problem for rank 3 oriented matroids.

"On sensing capacity of sensor networks for the class of linear
  observation, fixed SNR models","  In this paper we address the problem of finding the sensing capacity of
sensor networks for a class of linear observation models and a fixed SNR
regime. Sensing capacity is defined as the maximum number of signal dimensions
reliably identified per sensor observation. In this context sparsity of the
phenomena is a key feature that determines sensing capacity. Precluding the SNR
of the environment the effect of sparsity on the number of measurements
required for accurate reconstruction of a sparse phenomena has been widely
dealt with under compressed sensing. Nevertheless the development there was
motivated from an algorithmic perspective. In this paper our aim is to derive
these bounds in an information theoretic set-up and thus provide algorithm
independent conditions for reliable reconstruction of sparse signals. In this
direction we first generalize the Fano's inequality and provide lower bounds to
the probability of error in reconstruction subject to an arbitrary distortion
criteria. Using these lower bounds to the probability of error, we derive upper
bounds to sensing capacity and show that for fixed SNR regime sensing capacity
goes down to zero as sparsity goes down to zero. This means that
disproportionately more sensors are required to monitor very sparse events. Our
next main contribution is that we show the effect of sensing diversity on
sensing capacity, an effect that has not been considered before. Sensing
diversity is related to the effective \emph{coverage} of a sensor with respect
to the field. In this direction we show the following results (a) Sensing
capacity goes down as sensing diversity per sensor goes down; (b) Random
sampling (coverage) of the field by sensors is better than contiguous location
sampling (coverage).

Black-body components in Gamma-Ray Bursts spectra?,"  We study 7 Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs), detected both by the BATSE instrument,

sizeable fraction of the bursts defining the correlation between the peak
energy E_peak (i.e. the peak of the vFv spectrum) and the total prompt
isotropic energy E_iso (the so called ""Amati"" relation). Recent theoretical
interpretations of this correlation assume that black-body emission dominates
the time resolved spectra of GRBs, even if, in the time integrated spectrum,
its presence may be hidden by the change of its temperature and by the dilution
of a possible non-thermal power law component. We perform a time resolved
spectral analysis, and show that the sum of a power-law and a black-body gives
acceptable fits to the time dependent spectra within the BATSE energy range,
but overpredicts the flux in the WFC X-ray range. Moreover, a fit with a cutoff
power-law plus a black-body is consistent with the WFC data, but the black-body
component contributes a negligible fraction of the total flux. On the contrary,
we find that fitting the spectra with a Band model or a simple cutoff power-law

The symmetric heavy-light ansatz,"  The symmetric heavy-light ansatz is a method for finding the ground state of

original Hamiltonian has an exact Z_2 symmetry, the heavy-light ansatz breaks
this symmetry by skewing the mass ratio of the two components. In the limit
where one component is infinitely heavy, the many-body problem can be solved in
terms of single-particle orbitals. The original Z_2 symmetry is recovered by
enforcing Z_2 symmetry as a constraint on N-body density correlations for the
two components. For the 1D, 2D, and 3D attractive Hubbard models the method is

Finite Euler products and the Riemann Hypothesis,"  We show that if the Riemann Hypothesis is true, then in a region containing
most of the right-half of the critical strip, the Riemann zeta-function is well
approximated by short truncations of its Euler product. Conversely, if the
approximation by products is good in this region, the zeta-function has at most
finitely many zeros in it. We then construct a parameterized family of
non-analytic functions with this same property. With the possible exception of
a finite number of zeros off the critical line, every function in the family
satisfies a Riemann Hypothesis. Moreover, when the parameter is not too large,
they have about the same number of zeros as the zeta-function, their zeros are
all simple, and they ""repel"". The structure of these functions makes the reason
for the simplicity and repulsion of their zeros apparent and suggests a
mechanism that might be responsible for the corresponding properties of the
zeta-function's zeros. Computer evidence suggests that the zeros of functions
in the family are remarkably close to those of the zeta-function (even for
small values of the parameter), and we show that they indeed converge to them
as the parameter increases. Furthermore, between zeros of the zeta-function,
the moduli of functions in the family tend to twice the modulus of the
zeta-function. Both assertions assume the Riemann Hypothesis. We end by
discussing analogues for other L-functions and show how they give insight into
the study of the distribution of zeros of linear combinations of L-functions.

Spectral methods for orthogonal rational functions,"  An operator theoretic approach to orthogonal rational functions on the unit
circle with poles in its exterior is presented in this paper. This approach is
based on the identification of a suitable matrix representation of the
multiplication operator associated with the corresponding orthogonality
measure. Two different alternatives are discussed, depending whether we use for
the matrix representation the standard basis of orthogonal rational functions,
or a new one with poles alternatively located in the exterior and the interior

transformations with matrix coefficients acting respectively on Hessenberg and
five-diagonal unitary matrices.
  In consequence, the orthogonality measure can be recovered from the spectral
measure of an infinite unitary matrix depending uniquely on the poles and the
parameters of the recurrence relation for the orthogonal rational functions.
Besides, the zeros of the orthogonal and para-orthogonal rational functions are
identified as the eigenvalues of matrix linear fractional transformations of
finite Hessenberg and five-diagonal matrices.
  As an application of this operator approach, we obtain new relations between
the support of the orthogonality measure and the location of the poles and
parameters of the recurrence relation, generalizing to the rational case known
results for orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle.
  Finally, we extend these results to orthogonal polynomials on the real line

Radiative properties of a linear chain of coupled qubits,"  We calculate the radiative properties for a linear dipole-coupled chain of

a specific atom, the radiation tends to be focused either along or
perpendicular to the chain. We conclude with a derivation of the total decay
rate of the one-photon eigenstates, and find the interesting result that for
systems where the photon wavenumber is not much larger than the interatomic
spacing, up to 94% of the eigenstates are subradiant, that is, they decay
significantly slower than a single atom in isolation.

Transient X-ray Emission from Normal Galactic Nuclei,"  X-ray transients appeared in optically non-active galactic nuclei have been
observed in recent years. The most popular model explaining this kind of
phenomena is the conventional tidal disruption model. In this model, when a
star moves within the tidal radius of a black hole, part of the star materials
will fall into the black hole through an accretion disk, which gives rise to
the luminous flare. We propose that the X-ray emission may not necessarily come
from radiation of the accretion disk alone. Instead, it may be related to a
jet. As the jet travels in the interstellar medium, a shock is produced and
synchrotron radiation is expected. We compared the model light curve and the
synchrotron radiation spectrum with the observed data, and find that our model
explains the observed light curve and late-time spectrum well. Our model
predicts that these transient active galactic nuclei could be sources of the

"An iterative method to compute the sign function of a non-Hermitian
  matrix and its application to the overlap Dirac operator at nonzero chemical
  potential","  The overlap Dirac operator in lattice QCD requires the computation of the
sign function of a matrix. While this matrix is usually Hermitian, it becomes
non-Hermitian in the presence of a quark chemical potential. We show how the
action of the sign function of a non-Hermitian matrix on an arbitrary vector

subspace approximation based on the Arnoldi algorithm is described for the
evaluation of a generic matrix function. The efficiency of the method is
spoiled when the matrix has eigenvalues close to a function discontinuity. This
is cured by adding a small number of critical eigenvectors to the Krylov
subspace, for which we propose two different deflation schemes. The ensuing
modified Arnoldi method is then applied to the sign function, which has a
discontinuity along the imaginary axis. The numerical results clearly show the
improved efficiency of the method. Our modification is particularly effective
when the action of the sign function of the same matrix has to be computed many

"New scaling relations in cluster radio halos and the re-acceleration
  model","  In this paper we derive new expected scaling relations for clusters with
giant radio halos in the framework of the re-acceleration scenario in a
simplified, but physically motivated, form, namely: radio power (P_R) vs size
of the radio emitting region (R_H), and P_R vs total cluster mass (M_H)
contained in the emitting region and cluster velocity dispersion (sigma_H) in
this region.
  We search for these correlations by analyzing the most recent radio and X-ray
data available in the literature for a well known sample of clusters with giant
radio halos. In particular we find a good correlation between P_R and R_H and a
very tight ``geometrical'' scaling between M_H and R_H. From these correlations
P_R is also expected to scale with M_H and sigma_H and this is confirmed by our
analysis. We show that all the observed trends can be well reconciled with
expectations in the case of a slight variation of the mean magnetic field
strength in the radio halo volume with M_H. A byproduct correlation between R_H
and sigma_H is also found, and can be further tested by optical studies. In
addition, we find that observationally R_H scales non-linearly with the virial
radius of the host cluster, and this immediately means that the fraction of the
cluster volume which is radio emitting increases with cluster mass and thus
that the non-thermal component in clusters is not self-similar.

Holes within galaxies: the egg or the hen?,"  Unsustained matter distributions unescapely collapse unless fragmentation and
centrifugal or pressure support take place. Starting from the above evidence,
supermassive compact objects at the centre of large-mass galaxies are conceived
as the end-product of the gravitational collapse of local density maxima around
which overdensities are located. At the beginning of evolution, local density
maxima are idealized as homogeneous peaks, while the surrounding envelopes are
described by a power-law density profile. The dependence of the density profile
on a second parameter, chosen to be the ratio between peak and total mass, is
analysed. Overdensity evolution is discussed in the context of quintessence
cosmological models and further investigation is devoted to a special case with
the aim to describe the central collapse. An empirical relation between hole
and dark halo mass is translated into a dependence of the fractional hole mass
on the overdensity mass. Computations are performed up to the end of central
collapse, and density profiles of related configurations are determined
together with additional parameters. The central collapse is completed in early
times, no longer than a few hundredths of Gyr, which implies hole formation
when proto-haloes, proto-bulges, and proto-disks are still expanding or
contracting. No appreciable change in evolution is found with regard to
different mean peak heights related to equal masses. On the other hand, it is
recognized that homogeneous peaks collapse ``faster'' with respect to
surroundings envelopes, in low-mass than in large-mass overdensities. In
conclusion, it is inferred that gravitational collapse of homogeneous peaks
within overdensities may be a viable mechanism for hole generation.

exceeds the ASTROD I acceleration noise budget requirement. Continuous

"Interplay between magnetic properties and thermoelectricity in misfit
  and Na cobaltates","  We present a comparative study of CoO2 layers in the Bi-misfit and NaxCoO2
cobaltates. Co NMR measures the intrinsic susceptibility of the Co layers and
is not affected by spurious contributions. At low dopings where
room-temperature thermopower (TEP) is large, Curie-Weiss susceptibilities are
observed in both materials. But NMR and muSR experiments find neither charge
nor spin order down to low temperatures in Bi-misfit, in contrast to the case
of NaxCoO2. This demonstrates that metallicity, charge and magnetic orders are
specific of the Na layers in NaxCoO2 whereas strong correlations are generic of
the cobaltates physics and could explain the large TEP.

"Gamma-ray production in young open clusters: Berk 87, Cyg OB2 and
  Westerlund 2","  Young open clusters are likely sites of cosmic ray acceleration as indicated
by recent detections of the TeV gamma-ray sources in the directions of two open
clusters (Cyg OB2 and Westerlund 2) and their directional proximity to some
unidentified EGRET sources. In fact, up to now a few different scenarios for
acceleration of particles inside open clusters have been considered, i.e.
shocks in massive star winds, pulsars and their nebulae, supernova shocks,
massive compact binaries. Here we consider in detail the radiation processes
due to both electrons and hadrons accelerated inside the open cluster. As a
specific scenario, we apply the acceleration process at the shocks arising in
the winds of WR type stars. Particles diffuse through the medium of the open
cluster during the activity time of the acceleration scenario defined by the
age of the WR star. They interact with the matter and radiation, at first
inside the open cluster and, later in the dense surrounding clouds. We
calculate the broad band spectrum in different processes for three example open
clusters (Berk 87, Cyg OB2, Westerlund 2) for which the best observational
constraints on the spectra are at present available. It is assumed that the
high energy phenomena, observed from the X-ray up to the GeV-TeV gamma-ray
energies, are related to each other. We conclude that the most likely
description of the radiation processes in these objects is achieved in the
hybrid (leptonic-hadronic) model in which leptons are responsible for the
observed X-ray and GeV gamma-ray emission and hadrons are responsible for the
TeV gamma-ray emission, which is produced directly inside and in dense clouds

"MgB2 single crystals substituted with Li and with Li-C: Structural and
  superconducting properties","  The effect of Li substitution for Mg and of Li-C co-substitution on the
superconducting properties and crystal structure of MgB2 single crystals has
been investigated. It has been found that hole doping with Li decreases the
superconducting transition temperature Tc, but at a slower rate than electron
doping with C or Al. Tc of MgB2 crystals with simultaneously substituted Li for
Mg and C for B decreases more than in the case where C is substituted alone.
This means that holes introduced by Li cannot counterbalance the effect of
decrease of Tc caused by introduction of electrons coming from C. The possible
reason of it can be that holes coming from Li occupy the pi band while
electrons coming from C fill the sigma band. The temperature dependences of the
upper critical field Hc2 for Al and Li substituted crystals with the same Tc
show a similar dHc2/dT slope at Tc and a similar Hc2(T) behavior, despite of
much different substitution level. This indicates that the mechanism
controlling Hc2 and Tc is similar in both hole and electron doped crystals.
Electrical transport measurements show an increase of resistivity both in Li
substituted crystals and in Li and C co-substituted crystals. This indicates
enhanced scattering due to defects introduced by substitutions including
distortion of the lattice. The observed behavior can be explained as a result
of two effects, influencing both Tc and Hc2. The first one is doping related to
the changes in the carrier concentration, which may lead to the decrease or to
the increase of Tc. The second one is related to the introduction of new
scattering centers leading to the modification of the interband and/or
intraband scattering and therefore, to changes in the superconducting gaps and
to the reduction of Tc.

"On Correlated Random Walks and 21-cm Fluctuations During Cosmic

analytical expression for the statistics of two correlated random walks has
been previously found only for the case of a constant barrier height. However,
calculating bubble sizes or accurate statistics for halo formation involves

Inflationary Perturbations: the Cosmological Schwinger Effect,"  This pedagogical review aims at presenting the fundamental aspects of the
theory of inflationary cosmological perturbations of quantum-mechanical origin.
The analogy with the well-known Schwinger effect is discussed in detail and a
systematic comparison of the two physical phenomena is carried out. In
particular, it is demonstrated that the two underlying formalisms differ only
up to an irrelevant canonical transformation. Hence, the basic physical
mechanisms at play are similar in both cases and can be reduced to the
quantization of a parametric oscillator leading to particle creation due to the
interaction with a classical source: pair production in vacuum is therefore
equivalent to the appearance of a growing mode for the cosmological
fluctuations. The only difference lies in the nature of the source: an electric
field in the case of the Schwinger effect and the gravitational field in the
case of inflationary perturbations. Although, in the laboratory, it is
notoriously difficult to produce an electric field such that pairs extracted
from the vacuum can be detected, the gravitational field in the early universe
can be strong enough to lead to observable effects that ultimately reveal
themselves as temperature fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave Background.
Finally, the question of how quantum cosmological perturbations can be

Modelling diffusional transport in the interphase cell nucleus,"  In this paper a lattice model for diffusional transport of particles in the
interphase cell nucleus is proposed. Dense networks of chromatin fibers are
created by three different methods: randomly distributed, non-interconnected
obstacles, a random walk chain model, and a self avoiding random walk chain
model with persistence length. By comparing a discrete and a continuous version
of the random walk chain model, we demonstrate that lattice discretization does
not alter particle diffusion. The influence of the 3D geometry of the fiber
network on the particle diffusion is investigated in detail, while varying
occupation volume, chain length, persistence length and walker size. It is
shown that adjacency of the monomers, the excluded volume effect incorporated
in the self avoiding random walk model, and, to a lesser extent, the
persistence length, affect particle diffusion. It is demonstrated how the
introduction of the effective chain occupancy, which is a convolution of the
geometric chain volume with the walker size, eliminates the conformational

coefficient as a function of the effective chain volume, the data fall onto a

It could well be that the drifting subpulse mechanism is an intrinsic property
of the emission mechanism itself, although for some pulsars it is difficult or
impossible to detect. Drifting subpulses are in general found at both
frequencies, although the chance of detecting drifting subpulses is possibly
slightly higher at 92 cm. It appears that the youngest pulsars have the most
disordered subpulses and the subpulses become more and more organized into
drifting subpulses as the pulsar ages. The correlations with the modulation
indices are argued to be consistent with the picture in which the radio
emission can be divided in a drifting subpulse signal plus a quasi-steady
signal which becomes, on average, stronger at high observing frequencies. The
measured values of P3 at the two frequencies are highly correlated, but there
is no evidence for a correlation with other pulsar parameters.

"The subpulse modulation properties of pulsars at 92 cm and the frequency
  dependence of subpulse modulation","The research paper titled ""The subpulse modulation properties of pulsars at 92 cm and the frequency dependence of subpulse modulation"" investigates the properties of subpulse modulation in pulsars at a frequency of 92 cm. The central theme of the paper is to understand the frequency dependence of subpulse modulation and its potential implications for our understanding of pulsar emission mechanisms. 
The researchers used data from the LOFAR radio telescope to study the subpulse modulation in six pulsars at 92 cm. They found that the subpulse modulation properties varied significantly between pulsars, indicating that there is no universal mechanism for subpulse modulation. 
Furthermore, the researchers found that the frequency dependence of subpulse modulation was not consistent across the sample of pulsars. This suggests that the underlying emission mechanisms for subpulse modulation may be complex and not easily explained by a single model. 
Overall, the paper's findings highlight the need for further research to better understand subpulse modulation and its relationship to pulsar emission mechanisms.",True,1

"The evolution of interstellar clouds in a streaming hot plasma including
  heat conduction","  To examine the evolution of giant molecular clouds in the stream of a hot
plasma we performed two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations that take full
account of self-gravity, heating and cooling effects and heat conduction by
electrons. We use the thermal conductivity of a fully ionized hydrogen plasma
proposed by Spitzer and a saturated heat flux according to Cowie & McKee in
regions where the mean free path of the electrons is large compared to the
temperature scaleheight. Significant structural and evolutionary differences
occur between simulations with and without heat conduction. Dense clouds in
pure dynamical models experience dynamical destruction by Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH)
instability. In static models heat conduction leads to evaporation of such
clouds. Heat conduction acting on clouds in a gas stream smooths out steep
temperature and density gradients at the edge of the cloud because the
conduction timescale is shorter than the cooling timescale. This diminishes the
velocity gradient between the streaming plasma and the cloud, so that the
timescale for the onset of KH instabilities increases, and the surface of the
cloud becomes less susceptible to KH instabilities. The stabilisation effect of
heat conduction against KH instability is more pronounced for smaller and less
massive clouds. As in the static case more realistic cloud conditions allow
heat conduction to transfer hot material onto the cloud's surface and to mix
the accreted gas deeper into the cloud.

velocity dispersion at fixed richness. The mean velocity dispersion increases

"Entanglement and topological entropy of the toric code at finite
  temperature","  We calculate exactly the von Neumann and topological entropies of the toric
code as a function of system size and temperature. We do so for systems with
infinite energy scale separation between magnetic and electric excitations, so
that the magnetic closed loop structure is fully preserved while the electric
loop structure is tampered with by thermally excited electric charges. We find
that the entanglement entropy is a singular function of temperature and system
size, and that the limit of zero temperature and the limit of infinite system
size do not commute. From the entanglement entropy we obtain the topological
entropy, which is shown to drop to half its zero-temperature value for any
infinitesimal temperature in the thermodynamic limit, and remains constant as
the temperature is further increased. Such discontinuous behavior is replaced
by a smooth decreasing function in finite-size systems. If the separation of
energy scales in the system is large but finite, we argue that our results hold
at small enough temperature and finite system size, and a second drop in the
topological entropy should occur as the temperature is raised so as to disrupt
the magnetic loop structure by allowing the appearance of free magnetic
charges. We interpret our results as an indication that the underlying magnetic
and electric closed loop structures contribute equally to the topological
entropy (and therefore to the topological order) in the system. Since each loop
structure \emph{per se} is a classical object, we interpret the quantum

Astrophysical Accretion as an Analogue Gravity Phenomena,"  In recent years, strong analogies have been established between the physics
of acoustic perturbations in an inhomogeneous dynamical fluid system, and some
kinematic features of space-time in general relativity. An effective metric,
referred to as the `acoustic metric', which describes the geometry of the
manifold in which acoustic perturbations propagate, can be constructed. This
effective geometry can capture the properties of curved space-time in general
relativity. Physical models constructed utilizing such analogies are called
`analogue gravity models'. Classical analogue gravity effect may be observed
when acoustic perturbations propagate through a inhomogeneous transonic
classical fluid. The acoustic horizon, which resembles a black hole event
horizon in many ways, is generated at the transonic point in the fluid flow.
The acoustic horizon is essentially a null hyper surface, generators of which
are the acoustic null geodesics, i.e. the phonons. The acoustic horizon emits
acoustic radiation with quasi thermal phonon spectra, which is analogous to the
actual Hawking radiation. The temperature of the radiation emitted from the
acoustic horizon is referred to as the analogue Hawking temperature.
  It has been demonstrated that, in general, the transonic accretion in
astrophysics can be considered as an example of the classical analogue gravity
model naturally found in the Universe.

"Predicting the connectivity of primate cortical networks from
  topological and spatial node properties","  The organization of the connectivity between mammalian cortical areas has
become a major subject of study, because of its important role in scaffolding
the macroscopic aspects of animal behavior and intelligence. In this study we
present a computational reconstruction approach to the problem of network
organization, by considering the topological and spatial features of each area
in the primate cerebral cortex as subsidy for the reconstruction of the global
cortical network connectivity. Starting with all areas being disconnected,
pairs of areas with similar sets of features are linked together, in an attempt
to recover the original network structure. Inferring primate cortical
connectivity from the properties of the nodes, remarkably good reconstructions
of the global network organization could be obtained, with the topological
features allowing slightly superior accuracy to the spatial ones. Analogous
reconstruction attempts for the C. elegans neuronal network resulted in
substantially poorer recovery, indicating that cortical area interconnections
are relatively stronger related to the considered topological and spatial
properties than neuronal projections in the nematode. The close relationship
between area-based features and global connectivity may hint on developmental
rules and constraints for cortical networks. Particularly, differences between
the predictions from topological and spatial properties, together with the
poorer recovery resulting from spatial properties, indicate that the
organization of cortical networks is not entirely determined by spatial
constraints.

"The Intrinsic Origin of Spin Echoes in Dipolar Solids Generated by
  Strong Pi Pulses","  In spectroscopy, it is conventional to treat pulses much stronger than the
linewidth as delta-functions. In NMR, this assumption leads to the prediction
that pi pulses do not refocus the dipolar coupling. However, NMR spin echo
measurements in dipolar solids defy these conventional expectations when more
than one pi pulse is used. Observed effects include a long tail in the CPMG
echo train for short delays between pi pulses, an even-odd asymmetry in the
echo amplitudes for long delays, an unusual fingerprint pattern for
intermediate delays, and a strong sensitivity to pi-pulse phase. Experiments
that set limits on possible extrinsic causes for the phenomena are reported. We
find that the action of the system's internal Hamiltonian during any real pulse
is sufficient to cause the effects. Exact numerical calculations, combined with
average Hamiltonian theory, identify novel terms that are sensitive to
parameters such as pulse phase, dipolar coupling, and system size.
Visualization of the entire density matrix shows a unique flow of quantum

Disordering Transitions and Peak Effect in Polydisperse Particle Systems,"  We show numerically that in a binary system of Yukawa particles, a dispersity
driven disordering transition occurs. In the presence of quenched disorder this
disordering transition coincides with a marked increase in the depinning
threshold, known as a peak effect. We find that the addition of poorly pinned
particles can increase the overall pinning in the sample by increasing the
amount of topological disorder present. If the quenched disorder is strong
enough to create a significant amount of topological disorder in the
monodisperse system, addition of a poorly pinned species generates further
disorder but does not produce a peak in the depinning force. Our results
indicate that for binary mixtures, optimal pinning occurs for topological
defect fraction densities of 0.2 to 0.25. For defect densities below this
range, the system retains orientational order. We determine the effect of the
pinning density, strength, and radius on the depinning peak and find that the

form which is very similar to Coleman-Weinberg potential. We evaluate
coefficients appearing in the effective potential by employing zeta function
regularization and heat kernel analysis. The volume modulus is stabilized for
smaller degrees of warping, below a critical value, which depends on deficit
angle of the reference brane. After stabilizing the modulus, it is possible to
obtain observed values of the mass ratio between the fundamental energy scales

differential equations in terms of the density of the fading distribution. In
the optimal power distribution, as SNR increases, the allocation over the
higher layers remains unchanged; rather the extra power is allocated towards
the lower layers. On the other hand, as the bandwidth ratio b (channel uses per
source symbol) tends to zero, the power distribution that minimizes expected
distortion converges to the power distribution that maximizes expected

Scalar damage model for concrete without explicit evolution law,"  Based on the fact that for an isotropic material model the elastic predictor

"Mass loss from Luminous Blue Variables and Quasi-Periodic Modulations of
  Radio Supernovae","  Massive stars, supernovae (SNe), and long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)
have a huge impact on their environment. Despite their importance, a
comprehensive knowledge of which massive stars produce which SN/GRB is hitherto
lacking. We present a brief overview about our knowledge of mass loss in the
Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram (HRD) covering evolutionary phases of the OB main
sequence, the unstable Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) stage, and the Wolf-Rayet
(WR) phase. Despite the fact that metals produced by ``self-enrichment'' in WR
atmospheres exceed the initial -- host galaxy -- metallicity, by orders of
magnitude, a particularly strong dependence of the mass-loss rate on the
initial metallicity is found for WR stars at sub-solar metallicities (1/10 --
1/100 solar). This provides a significant boost to the collapsar model for
GRBs, as it may present a viable mechanism to prevent the loss of angular
momentum by stellar winds at low metallicity, whilst strong Galactic WR winds
may inhibit GRBs occurring at solar metallicities. Furthermore, we discuss
recently reported quasi-sinusoidal modulations in the radio lightcurves of SNe
2001ig and 2003bg. We show that both the sinusoidal behaviour and the
recurrence timescale of these modulations are consistent with the predicted
mass-loss behaviour of LBVs, and we suggest LBVs may be the progenitors of some

"Constraining GRB progenitor models by probing Wolf-Rayet wind geometries
  in the Large Magellanic Cloud","  The favoured progenitors of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are rapidly
rotating Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. However, most Galactic WR stars are slow
rotators, as stellar winds are thought to remove angular momentum. This poses a
challenge to the collapsar model. Recent observations indicate that GRBs occur
predominately in low metallicity (Z) environments, which may resolve the
problem: lower Z leads to less mass loss, which may inhibit angular momentum
removal, allowing WR stars to remain rotating rapidly until collapse. We wish
to determine whether low Z WR stars rotate on average more rapidly than
Galactic WR stars, and perform a Very Large Telescope (VLT) linear
spectropolarimetry survey of WR stars in the low Z environment of the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and compare our results with the Galactic sample. We
find that only 2 out of 13 (i.e. 15%) of LMC WR stars show line polarization
effects, compared to a similarly low fraction of ~15-20% for Galactic WR stars.
The low incidence of line polarization effects in LMC WR stars suggests that
the threshold metallicity where significant differences in WR rotational
properties occur is below that of the LMC (Z ~ 0.5 Zsun), possibly constraining
GRB progenitor channels to this upper metallicity.

The aqueous and crystalline forms of L-alanine zwitterion,"  The structural properties of L-alanine amino acid in aqueous solution and in

Spin-String Interaction in QCD Strings,"  I consider the question of the interaction between a QCD string and the spin

this dependence and determine the resonant relaxation timescale as a function
of eccentricity. In particular, we show that the component of the torque that

of an effective potential of oxygen with broad weakly upwards bottom at the xy
plane of tetragonal symmetry octahedron, which the interstitial atom occupies.

"The white dwarf luminosity function --II. The effect of the measurement
  errors and other biases","  Only the 1/V_max method has been employed so far for observationally
determining the white dwarf luminosity function, whereas for other kind of
luminosity functions several other methods have been frequently used. Moreover,
the procedures to determine the white dwarf luminosity function are not free of
biases. These biases have two different origins: they can either be of
statistical nature or a consequence of the measurement errors. In a previous
paper we carried out an in-depth study of the first category of biases for
several luminosity function estimators. In this paper we focus on the biases
introduced by the measurement errors and on the effects of the degree of
contamination of the input sample used to build the disc white dwarf luminosity
function by different kinematical populations. To assess the extent of these
biases we use a Monte Carlo simulator to generate a controlled synthetic
population and analyse the behaviour of the disc white dwarf luminosity
function for several assumptions about the magnitude of the measurement errors
and for several degrees of contamination, comparing the performances of the
most robust luminosity function estimators under such conditions.

"An automated system for lung nodule detection in low-dose computed
  tomography","Abstract:
Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection of lung nodules through low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening has been shown to increase the survival rate of patients. However, the manual detection of lung nodules in LDCT images is time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. Therefore, an automated system for lung nodule detection in LDCT images is highly desirable. In this paper, we propose an automated system for lung nodule detection in LDCT images using a deep learning approach. The proposed system consists of two main stages: candidate detection and false positive reduction. In the candidate detection stage, a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to detect potential nodules. Then, a false positive reduction stage is applied to remove non-nodule candidates using a combination of morphological operations and a 3D CNN classifier. The proposed system was evaluated on a publicly available dataset of LDCT images and achieved a sensitivity of 85.7% at 1 false positive per scan. The proposed system has the potential to assist radiologists in detecting lung nodules in LDCT images, leading to earlier diagnosis and improved patient outcomes.",True,1

On the stratified dust distribution of the GG Tau circumbinary ring,"  Our objective is to study the vertical dust distribution in the circumbinary

Evidence for Pre-SN Mass Loss in the Galactic SNR 3C 58,"  We discuss the findings of a comprehensive imaging and spectroscopic survey
of the optical emission associated with the supernova remnant 3C 58 (Fesen et

measured radial velocities of ~450 emission knots within the remnant show two
distinct kinematic populations of optical knots: a high-velocity group with
radial velocities in the range of 700 - 1100 km/s and a lower velocity group

potential fossil fuel reserves are uncertain and debated. Regardless of the
true values, society has flexibility in the degree to which it chooses to
exploit these reserves, especially unconventional fossil fuels and those
located in extreme or pristine environments. If conventional oil production
peaks within the next few decades, it may have a large effect on future
atmospheric CO2 and climate change, depending upon subsequent energy choices.
Assuming that proven oil and gas reserves do not greatly exceed estimates of
the Energy Information Administration, and recent trends are toward lower
estimates, we show that it is feasible to keep atmospheric CO2 from exceeding
about 450 ppm by 2100, provided that emissions from coal, unconventional fossil
fuels, and land use are constrained. Coal-fired power plants without
sequestration must be phased out before mid-century to achieve this CO2 limit.
It is also important to ""stretch"" conventional oil reserves via energy
conservation and efficiency, thus averting strong pressures to extract liquid
fuels from coal or unconventional fossil fuels while clean technologies are
being developed for the era ""beyond fossil fuels"". We argue that a rising price
on carbon emissions is needed to discourage conversion of the vast fossil
resources into usable reserves, and to keep CO2 beneath the 450 ppm ceiling.

"Implications of ""peak oil"" for atmospheric CO2 and climate","This research paper explores the implications of ""peak oil"" on atmospheric CO2 and climate. The main objective of the study is to understand how the depletion of oil reserves could impact global carbon emissions and climate change. The paper reviews the current state of global oil reserves and the potential impact of peak oil on carbon emissions. The study also examines the possible strategies that could be implemented to mitigate the effects of peak oil on climate change. The key findings suggest that peak oil may lead to a reduction in carbon emissions, but this effect may be temporary and short-lived. Additionally, the study highlights the need for alternative energy sources to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and mitigate the effects of climate change. In conclusion, the research paper emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive and sustainable energy policy that can address the challenges of peak oil and climate change.",True,1
Nonlinear Evolution of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations,"  We study the nonlinear evolution of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in
the dark matter power spectrum and correlation function using renormalized
perturbation theory (RPT). In a previous paper we showed that RPT successfully
predicts the damping of acoustic oscillations; here we extend our calculation
to the enhancement of power due to mode-coupling. We show that mode-coupling
generates additional oscillations that are out of phase with those in the
linear spectrum, leading to shifts in the scales of oscillation nodes defined
with respect to a smooth spectrum. When Fourier transformed, these out of phase
oscillations induce percent-level shifts in the acoustic peak of the two-point
correlation function. We present predictions for these shifts as a function of
redshift; these should be considered as a robust lower limit to the more
realistic case that includes in addition redshift distortions and galaxy bias.
We show that these nonlinear effects occur at very large scales, leading to a
breakdown of linear theory at scales much larger than commonly thought. We
discuss why virialized halo profiles are not responsible for these effects,
which can be understood from basic physics of gravitational instability. Our
results are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations, and can be used
as a starting point for modeling BAO in future observations. To meet this end,
we suggest a simple physically motivated model to correct for the shifts caused
by mode-coupling.

Exploring Continuous Tensegrities,"  A discrete tensegrity framework can be thought of as a graph in Euclidean
n-space where each edge is of one of three types: an edge with a fixed length
(bar) or an edge with an upper (cable) or lower (strut) bound on its length.
Roth and Whiteley, in their 1981 paper ""Tensegrity Frameworks"", showed that in
certain cases, the struts and cables can be replaced with bars when analyzing
the framework for infinitesimal rigidity. In that case we call the tensegrity
""bar equivalent"". In specific, they showed that if there exists a set of
positive weights, called a positive ""stress"", on the edges such that the
weighted sum of the edge vectors is zero at every vertex, then the tensegrity
is bar equivalent.
  In this paper we consider an extended version of the tensegrity framework in
which the vertex set is a (possibly infinite) set of points in Euclidean
n-space and the edgeset is a compact set of unordered pairs of vertices. These
are called ""continuous tensegrities"". We show that if a continuous tensegrity
has a strictly positive stress, it is bar equivalent and that it has a
semipositive stress if and only if it is partially bar equivalent. We also show
that if a tensegrity is minimally bar equivalent (it is bar equivalent but
removing any open set of edges makes it no longer so), then it has a strictly
positive stress.
  In particular, we examine the case where the vertices form a rectifiable
curve and the possible motions of the curve are limited to local isometries of
it. Our methods provide an attractive proof of the following result: There is
no locally arclength preserving motion of a circle that increases any antipodal
distance without decreasing some other one.

The paper concludes by highlighting the potential applications of continuous tensegrities in fields such as robotics, space exploration, and biomedical engineering.

"Writing on Dirty Paper with Resizing and its Application to Quasi-Static
  Fading Broadcast Channels","  This paper studies a variant of the classical problem of ``writing on dirty
paper'' in which the sum of the input and the interference, or dirt, is
multiplied by a random variable that models resizing, known to the decoder but
not to the encoder. The achievable rate of Costa's dirty paper coding (DPC)
scheme is calculated and compared to the case of the decoder's also knowing the
dirt. In the ergodic case, the corresponding rate loss vanishes asymptotically
in the limits of both high and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and is small at
all finite SNR for typical distributions like Rayleigh, Rician, and Nakagami.
In the quasi-static case, the DPC scheme is lossless at all SNR in terms of
outage probability. Quasi-static fading broadcast channels (BC) without
transmit channel state information (CSI) are investigated as an application of
the robustness properties. It is shown that the DPC scheme leads to an outage

Deterministic characterization of stochastic genetic circuits,"  For cellular biochemical reaction systems where the numbers of molecules is
small, significant noise is associated with chemical reaction events. This
molecular noise can give rise to behavior that is very different from the
predictions of deterministic rate equation models. Unfortunately, there are few
analytic methods for examining the qualitative behavior of stochastic systems.
Here we describe such a method that extends deterministic analysis to include
leading-order corrections due to the molecular noise. The method allows the
steady-state behavior of the stochastic model to be easily computed,
facilitates the mapping of stability phase diagrams that include stochastic
effects and reveals how model parameters affect noise susceptibility, in a
manner not accessible to numerical simulation. By way of illustration we
consider two genetic circuits: a bistable positive-feedback loop and a
negative-feedback oscillator. We find in the positive feedback circuit that
translational activation leads to a far more stable system than transcriptional
control. Conversely, in a negative-feedback loop triggered by a
positive-feedback switch, the stochasticity of transcriptional control is
harnessed to generate reproducible oscillations.

Cascading Behavior in Large Blog Graphs,"  How do blogs cite and influence each other? How do such links evolve? Does
the popularity of old blog posts drop exponentially with time? These are some
of the questions that we address in this work. Our goal is to build a model
that generates realistic cascades, so that it can help us with link prediction
and outlier detection.
  Blogs (weblogs) have become an important medium of information because of
their timely publication, ease of use, and wide availability. In fact, they
often make headlines, by discussing and discovering evidence about political
events and facts. Often blogs link to one another, creating a publicly

rumors, viruses, and ideas propagate over social and computer networks.

Coupled-cluster theory for three-body Hamiltonians,"  We derive coupled-cluster equations for three-body Hamiltonians. The
equations for the one- and two-body cluster amplitudes are presented in a
factorized form that leads to an efficient numerical implementation. We employ
low-momentum two- and three-nucleon interactions and calculate the binding
energy of He-4. The results show that the main contribution of the

"The generator coordinate method in time-dependent density-functional

a conceptually and computationally simple tool to build memory effects into any
existing adiabatic XC potential. As an illustration, the method is applied to
driven parametric oscillations of two interacting electrons in a harmonic

Cryptoplanet update,"  We have had several talks recently reviewing 11 years of exoplanet
discoveries through radial velocity variations, or from transits, or from
microlensing. More than 200 exoplanets have been found, including some around
pulsars that we do not discuss here.
  My physical definition for a planet is a roughly spherical, self-gravitating
body more massive than 10**26 g formed from the leftover material in a
protostellar disk after the protostar forms. Radiation from the protostar
pushes the inner wall of the disk outward. The material agglomerates and forms
planets in radial sequence. The outer planets are formed slowly by classical
dynamical mechanisms acting in the snow zone. Planets have dense cores because
of agglomeration.
  Not one of the exoplanets discovered thus far is a planet. They are
cryptoplanets formed from matter ejected by protostars. When protostars have
excessive infall at high latitudes, they partially balance angular momentum
through outflow at the equator as they spin up. The ejected matter is trapped
in the magnetic torus formed between the star and the disk, like a tokamak. The
tokamak eventully reconnects and magnetic compression forms self-gravitating
remnants trapped and compressed by a closed spherical magnetic field,
spheromaks. Cooled spheromaks are cryptoplanets. They orbit near the star. They
can merge with each other or fall into the star or be ejected. They can grow by
accreting gas. They have a low density core and abundances characteristic of
the protostar. Their masses, radii, densities, and orbits are random, and are
inconsistent with the parameters for planets. They tend to have lower density
than planets.

"Mixed Hyperbolic - Second-Order Parabolic Formulations of General
  Relativity","  Two new formulations of general relativity are introduced. The first one is a
parabolization of the Arnowitt, Deser, Misner (ADM) formulation and is derived
by addition of combinations of the constraints and their derivatives to the
right-hand-side of the ADM evolution equations. The desirable property of this
modification is that it turns the surface of constraints into a local attractor
because the constraint propagation equations become second-order parabolic
independently of the gauge conditions employed. This system may be classified
as mixed hyperbolic - second-order parabolic. The second formulation is a
parabolization of the Kidder, Scheel, Teukolsky formulation and is a manifestly
mixed strongly hyperbolic - second-order parabolic set of equations, bearing
thus resemblance to the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. As a first test,
a stability analysis of flat space is carried out and it is shown that the
first modification exponentially damps and smoothes all constraint violating

Classical and quantum randomness and the financial market,"  We analyze complexity of financial (and general economic) processes by

meaningless, one may apply so called quantum-like models. In our approach
quantum-like probabilistic behaviour is a consequence of contextualy of
statistical data in finances (and economics in general). However, our
hypothesis on ""quantumness"" of financial data should be tested experimentally

Control of mechanical systems on Lie groups and ideal hydrodynamics,"  In contrast to the Euler-Poincar{\'e} reduction of geodesic flows of left- or
right-invariant metrics on Lie groups to the corresponding Lie algebra (or its

it is a velocity field for a stationary flow of an ideal fluid. Right- or
left-invariant symmetry fields of the reduced field define vortex manifolds for
such flows.
  Consider now a mechanical system, whose configuration space is a Lie group
and whose Lagrangian is invariant to left translations on that group, and
assume that the mass geometry of the system may change under the action of
internal control forces. Such system can also be reduced to the Lie group. With
no controls, this mechanical system describes a geodesic flow of the
left-invariant metric, given by the Lagrangian, and thus its reduced flow is a
stationary ideal fluid flow on the Lie group. The standard control problem for
such system is to find the conditions, under which the system can be brought
from any initial position in the configuration space to another preassigned
position by changing its mass geometry. We show that under these conditions, by
changing the mass geometry, one can also bring one vortex manifold to any other

"Considering the Case for Biodiversity Cycles: Reexamining the Evidence
  for Periodicity in the Fossil Record","  Medvedev and Melott (2007) have suggested that periodicity in fossil
biodiversity may be induced by cosmic rays which vary as the Solar System
oscillates normal to the galactic disk. We re-examine the evidence for a 62
million year (Myr) periodicity in biodiversity throughout the Phanerozoic
history of animal life reported by Rohde & Mueller (2005), as well as related
questions of periodicity in origination and extinction. We find that the signal

Examination of origination and extinction is somewhat ambiguous, with results
depending upon procedure. Origination and extinction intensity as defined by RM
may be affected by an artifact at 27 Myr in the duration of stratigraphic
intervals. Nevertheless, when a procedure free of this artifact is implemented,
the 27 Myr periodicity appears in origination, suggesting that the artifact may
ultimately be based on a signal in the data. A 62 Myr feature appears in
extinction, when this same procedure is used. We conclude that evidence for a
periodicity at 62 Myr is robust, and evidence for periodicity at approximately
27 Myr is also present, albeit more ambiguous.

trapped plasma can be supplied and replenished by either direct injection of
relativistic pairs from acceleration of externally-supplied particles in a

"Long Term Simulations Of Astrophysical Jets; Energy Structure and
  Quasi-Periodic Ejection","  We have performed self-consistent 2.5-dimensional nonsteady MHD numerical
simulations of jet formation as long as possible, including the dynamics of
accretion disks. Although the previous nonsteady MHD simulations for
astrophysical jets revealed that the characteristics of nonsteady jets are
similar to those of steady jets, the calculation time of these simulations is
very short compared with the time scale of observed jets. Thus we have
investigated long term evolutions of mass accretion rate, mass outflow rate,
jet velocity, and various energy flux. We found that the ejection of jet is
quasi-periodic. The period of the ejection is related to the time needed for
the initial magnetic filed to be twisted to generate toroidal filed. We compare
our results with both the steady state theory and previous 2.5-dimensional
nonsteady MHD simulations.

"Long Term Simulations Of Astrophysical Jets; Energy Structure and

In this paper, we present long-term simulations of astrophysical jets using numerical methods to explore the energy structure and quasi-periodic ejection phenomenon. Our simulations reveal that the energy structure of the jet is characterized by a power-law distribution, with the majority of the energy concentrated in the core region. Additionally, we find that the quasi-periodic ejection phenomenon can be attributed to the instability of the jet, which results in the formation of helical structures. Furthermore, our simulations demonstrate that the jet's energy flux is directly proportional to the power-law index, suggesting that the core region plays a crucial role in the jet's energy output. These findings shed new light on the energetics and dynamics of astrophysical jets, providing a better understanding of the role they play in the evolution of celestial objects.",True,1

The Magnetic Fields of Classical T Tauri Stars,"  We report new magnetic field measurements for 14 classical T Tauri stars
(CTTSs). We combine these data with one previous field determination in order

magnetospheric accretion models. We use literature data on the stellar mass,
radius, rotation period, and disk accretion rate to predict the field strength
that should be present on each of our stars according to these magnetospheric
accretion models. We show that our measured field values do not correlate with
the field strengths predicted by simple magnetospheric accretion theory. We
also use our field strength measurements and literature X-ray luminosity data

surface magnetic flux derived from various solar feature and main sequence star
measurements. We find that the T Tauri stars we have observed have weaker than

La controverse de 1874 entre Camille Jordan et Leopold Kronecker,"  During the whole of 1874, Camille Jordan and Leopold Kronecker quar- relled
vigorously over the organisation of the theory of bilinear forms. That theory
promised a ""general"" and ""homogeneous"" treatment of numerous questions arising
in various 19th-century theoretical contexts, and it hinged on two theorems,
stated independently by Jordan and Weierstrass, that would today be considered
equivalent. It was, however, the perceived difference between those two
theorems that sparked the 1874 controversy. Focusing on this quarrel allows us
to explore the algebraic identity of the polynomial practices of the
manipulations of forms in use before the advent of structural approaches to
linear algebra. The latter approaches identified these practices with methods
for the classification of similar matrices. We show that the prac- tices --
Jordan's canonical reduction and Kronecker's invariant computation -- reflect
identities inseparable from the social context of the time. Moreover, these
practices reveal not only tacit knowledge, local ways of thinking, but also --
in light of a long history tracing back to the work of Lagrange, Laplace, Cau-
chy, and Hermite -- two internal philosophies regarding the significance of
generality which are inseparable from two disciplinary ideals opposing algebra
and arithmetic. By interrogating the cultural identities of such practices,
this study aims at a deeper understanding of the history of linear algebra

Geometry of PT-symmetric quantum mechanics,"  Recently, much research has been carried out on Hamiltonians that are not

the geometrical structures that underlie quantum theories formulated in terms

corresponding to the parity operator, in particular, gives rise to a natural
partition of the Hilbert space into two halves corresponding to states having

An absorption origin for the soft excess in Seyfert 1 AGN,"  (abridged) The soft excess seen in the X-ray spectra of many high mass
accretion rate AGN can be well modelled by reflection from a partially ionised
accretion disc. However, the derived parameters are often extreme, both in
terms of the underlying spacetime and the reflection geometry, and these models
require that the disc is far from hydrostatic equilibrium. An alternative model
uses similarly partially ionised, velocity smeared material but seen in
absorption, though again the derived velocities are extreme, requiring magnetic
driving (in the jet?) rather than a simple line driven disc wind. We find that
while both models give comparably good fits to XMM--Newton data, we favour the
absorption model as, unlike reflection, all the derived spectral indices are
soft. This is as expected by analogy with the correspondingly high mass
accretion rate stellar mass black holes. Furthermore, these X-ray spectra are
consistent with a one--to--one mapping between AGN type and spectral state,
with NLS1's having softer spectra corresponding to the very high state, while
the broad line AGN have Gamma~2 as expected for the high/soft state. We also
use the simultaneous OM data to derive the ratio of disc to total accretion
power which is another tracer of spectral state in X-ray binaries. This does
not always show that the disc in NLS1's contributes less than 80 per cent of
the total power, as expected for a very high state. We suggest that this is an
artifact of the standard disc models used to determine the disc luminosity in
our fits. The disc seen in the very high state of black hole binaries is often
observed to be distorted from the standard shape, and a similar effect in
NLS1's could recover the correspondance between black hole binary spectral
state and AGN type.

Superconducting state of excitonic insulator,"  A state of an excitonic insulator with the electric current is studied.
Initially, in the metallic phase, the electrons and holes are assumed to be
moving in the opposite directions, so as the electric current exists. This
state is supported by an external condition (the specimen is in an electric
circuit with the current). When the temperature decreases, the transition to
the ordering state due to formation of the electron--hole pairs is possible
(similar to the ordinary state of the excitonic insulator). The properties of
the state at zero temperature are investigated. The spectrum of elementary
excitations has a gap, and so the conclusion can be made that obtained state is
superconducting one. Thus, depending on the external conditions, excitonic
insulator behaves itself like the insulator or superconductor. That is correct

states and electronic distribution along different crystalline planes.
Calculating results show that band gap in the majority spin band structure and
band gap in the minority spin band structure were found to be 2.7012 eV and

"Reconciliation of Zero-Point and Dark Energies in a Friedman Dust
  Universe with Einstein's Lambda","  In this paper, it is shown that the cosmological model that was introduced in
a sequence of three earlier papers under the title, A Dust Universe Solution to
the Dark Energy Problem, can be used to resolve the problem of the great
mismatch of numerical values between dark energy from cosmology and zero point
energy from quantum theory. It is shown that, if the zero point energies for
the cosmic microwave background and for all the rest of the universe that is
not cosmic microwave background are introduced into this model as two entities,
their separate values appear within this theory in the form of a numerical
difference. It is this difference that gives the numerical value for the zero
point value of Einstein's dark energy density. Consequently, although the two
zero point energies may be large, their difference can give the known small
dark energy value from cosmology for dark energy density. Issues relating to
interpretation, calculation and measurement associated with this result and an
interpretation of dark energy as a measure of polarisation of the vacuum are
discussed. In the first appendix to this paper, problems associated with the
standard model of cosmology are solved by redefining temperature in the dust
universe model. In the second appendix of this paper, an examination of the
dark matter problem in relation to a general relativistic generalisation of
Newton's inverse square law is undertaken. In the third appendix to this paper,
the formalism is used to derive a formula that gives a possible value for the

Accurate QCD predictions for heavy-quark jets at the Tevatron and LHC,"  Heavy-quark jets are important in many of today's collider studies and
searches, yet predictions for them are subject to much larger uncertainties
than for light jets. This is because of strong enhancements in higher orders
from large logarithms, ln(p_t/m_Q). We propose a new definition of heavy-quark
jets, which is free of final-state logarithms to all orders and such that all
initial-state collinear logarithms can be resummed into the heavy-quark parton
distributions. Heavy-jet spectra can then be calculated in the massless
approximation, which is simpler than a massive calculation and reduces the
theoretical uncertainties by a factor of three. This provides the first ever
accurate predictions for inclusive b- and c-jets, and the latter have
significant discriminatory power for the intrinsic charm content of the proton.
The techniques introduced here could be used to obtain heavy-flavour jet
results from existing massless next-to-leading order calculations for a wide
range of processes. We also discuss the experimental applicability of our

"Multidimensional supernova simulations with approximative neutrino
  transport. II. Convection and the advective-acoustic cycle in the supernova
  core","  By 2D hydrodynamic simulations including a detailed equation of state and
neutrino transport, we investigate the interplay between different non-radial
hydrodynamic instabilities that play a role during the postbounce accretion
phase of collapsing stellar cores. The convective mode of instability, which is
driven by negative entropy gradients caused by neutrino heating or by time
variations of the shock strength, can be identified clearly by the development
of typical Rayleigh-Taylor mushrooms. However, in cases where the gas in the
postshock region is rapidly advected towards the gain radius, the growth of
such a buoyancy instability can be suppressed. In such a situation the shocked
flow nevertheless can develop non-radial asymmetry with an oscillatory growth
of the amplitude. This phenomenon has been termed ``standing accretion shock
instability'' (SASI). It is shown here that the SASI oscillations can trigger
convective instability and like the latter they lead to an increase of the
average shock radius and of the mass in the gain layer. Both hydrodynamic
instabilities in combination stretch the advection time of matter through the
neutrino-heating layer and thus enhance the neutrino energy deposition in
support of the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. A rapidly contracting and
more compact nascent NS turns out to be favorable for explosions, because the
accretion luminosity and neutrino heating are larger and the growth rate of the
SASI is higher. Moreover, we show that the oscillation period of the SASI and a
variety of other features in our simulations agree with estimates for the
advective-acoustic cycle (AAC), in which perturbations are carried by the
accretion flow from the shock to the neutron star and pressure waves close an
amplifying global feedback loop. (abridged)

A balanced memory network,"  A fundamental problem in neuroscience is understanding how working memory --
the ability to store information at intermediate timescales, like 10s of

Using mean field analysis, we derive a three-variable description of attractor

"On the Critical Ionization Velocity Effect in Interstellar Space and
  Possible Detection of Related Continuum Emission","  Interstellar neutral hydrogen (HI) emission spectra manifest several families
of linewidths whose numerical values (34, 13 & 6 km/s) appear to be related to
the critical ionization velocities (CIVs) of the most abundant interstellar
atomic species. Extended new analysis of HI emission profiles shows that the 34
km/s wide component, probably corresponding to the CIV for helium, is
pervasive. The 34 km/s wide linewidth family is found in low-velocity (local)
neutral hydrogen (HI) profiles as well as in the so-called high-velocity
clouds. In addition, published studies of HI linewidths found in the Magellanic
Stream, Very-High-Velocity Clouds, and Compact High-Velocity Clouds, all of
which are believed to be intergalactic, have noted that typical values are of
the same order. If the critical ionization velocity effect does play a role in
interstellar space it may be expected to produce locally enhanced electron
densities where rapidly moving neutral gas masses interact with surrounding
plasma. Evidence is presented that suggests that this phenomenon is occurring
in interstellar space. It manifests as a spatial association between peaks in
HI structure offset with respect to peaks in high-frequency radio continuum
data obtained with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe.

significant part of one 35 day main-on state was covered. The cyclotron line in
the X-ray spectrum is well observed and its position and shape, as well as its
variability with time and phase of the 1.24 s pulsation are explored. X-ray
pulse profiles for different energy bands are studied throughout the
observation. The pulse period is found to vary on short time scales revealing a
dynamical spin-up/spin-down behavior. Results of simultaneous optical
observations of HZ Her are also discussed.

INTEGRAL observations of HER X-1,"This research paper presents an analysis of INTEGRAL observations of the X-ray binary system HER X-1. HER X-1 is a well-studied system that exhibits a 35-day periodicity in its X-ray emission, thought to be caused by the precession of its accretion disk. The INTEGRAL observations provide high-energy coverage of the system, allowing for a detailed investigation of the spectral and temporal characteristics of the X-ray emission.

Diffuse cosmic gamma-rays at 1-20 MeV: A trace of the dark matter?,"  Several independent observations of the galactic core suggest hitherto
unexplained sources of energy. The most well known case is the 511 keV line
which has proven very difficult to explain with conventional astrophysical
positron sources. A similar, but less well known mystery is the excess of
gamma-ray photons detected by COMPTEL across a broad energy range 1-20 MeV.
Such photons are found to be very difficult to produce via known astrophysical
sources. We show in this work that dark matter in the form of dense antimatter
droplets provides a natural explanations for the observed flux of gamma-rays in
the 1-20 MeV range. We argue thatsuch photons must always accompany the 511 keV
line as they produced by the same mechanism within our framework. We calculate
the spectrum and intensity of the 1-20 MeV gamma-rays, and find it to be
consistent with the COMPTEL data.

Diffuse cosmic gamma-rays at 1-20 MeV: A trace of the dark matter?,"This research paper discusses the possibility of diffuse cosmic gamma-rays at 1-20 MeV being a trace of dark matter.

The paper analyzes satellite data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope to investigate if the observed gamma-rays can be attributed to dark matter. The results show that it is possible that dark matter is responsible for the observed gamma-rays, but other sources cannot be ruled out.

"Ages for illustrative field stars using gyrochronology: viability,
  limitations and errors","  We here develop an improved way of using a rotating star as a clock, set it
using the Sun, and demonstrate that it keeps time well. This technique, called
gyrochronology, permits the derivation of ages for solar- and late-type main
sequence stars using only their rotation periods and colors. The technique is
clarified and developed here, and used to derive ages for illustrative groups
of nearby, late-type field stars with measured rotation periods. We first
demonstrate the reality of the interface sequence, the unifying feature of the
rotational observations of cluster and field stars that makes the technique
possible, and extends it beyond the proposal of Skumanich by specifying the
mass dependence of rotation for these stars. We delineate which stars it cannot
currently be used on. We then calibrate the age dependence using the Sun. The
errors are propagated to understand their dependence on color and period.
Representative age errors associated with the technique are estimated at ~15%
(plus possible systematic errors) for late-F, G, K, & early-M stars. Ages
derived via gyrochronology for the Mt. Wilson stars are shown to be in good
agreement with chromospheric ages for all but the bluest stars, and probably
superior. Gyro ages are then calculated for each of the active main sequence
field stars studied by Strassmeier and collaborators where other ages are not
available. These are shown to be mostly younger than 1Gyr, with a median age of
365Myr. The sample of single, late-type main sequence field stars assembled by
Pizzolato and collaborators is then assessed, and shown to have gyro ages
ranging from under 100Myr to several Gyr, and a median age of 1.2Gyr. Finally,
we demonstrate that the individual components of the three wide binaries
XiBooAB, 61CygAB, & AlphaCenAB yield substantially the same gyro ages.

The authors demonstrate that gyrochronology is a viable method for estimating the ages of stars, but caution that it is subject to errors and uncertainties, particularly in the case of stars that are rapidly rotating or have evolved off the main sequence. The study also highlights the importance of using multiple age indicators to improve the accuracy of age estimates. The main conclusion of the study is that gyrochronology can be a useful tool for studying the ages of field stars, but it should be used in conjunction with other age indicators to obtain the most accurate estimates.",True,1
Converting genetic network oscillations into somite spatial pattern,"  In most vertebrate species, the body axis is generated by the formation of
repeated transient structures called somites. This spatial periodicity in
somitogenesis has been related to the temporally sustained oscillations in
certain mRNAs and their associated gene products in the cells forming the
presomatic mesoderm. The mechanism underlying these oscillations have been
identified as due to the delays involved in the synthesis of mRNA and
translation into protein molecules [J. Lewis, Current Biol. {\bf 13}, 1398
(2003)]. In addition, in the zebrafish embryo intercellular Notch signalling
couples these oscillators and a longitudinal positional information signal in
the form of an Fgf8 gradient exists that could be used to transform these
coupled temporal oscillations into the observed spatial periodicity of somites.
Here we consider a simple model based on this known biology and study its
consequences for somitogenesis. Comparison is made with the known properties of
somite formation in the zebrafish embryo . We also study the effects of
localized Fgf8 perturbations on somite patterning.

Converting genetic network oscillations into somite spatial pattern,"The development of somites, the embryonic precursors of the vertebrate body segments, is regulated by a complex network of genetic interactions. This study aims to investigate how the oscillations observed in this network are converted into the spatial patterns observed in somite formation. Using mathematical modeling, we demonstrate that the synchronization of these oscillations is critical for generating the spatial patterns observed in somite formation. We show that the timing and duration of the oscillations are also important factors in determining the final somite pattern. Our results suggest that the genetic network regulating somite formation is highly sensitive to small changes in its parameters, indicating a robust and precise system. These findings provide insight into the mechanistic basis of somite formation and have implications for understanding the development of other complex biological systems.",True,1

On the detectability of non-trivial topologies,"  We explore the main physical processes which potentially affect the
topological signal in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) for a range of
toroidal universes. We consider specifically reionisation, the integrated
Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, the size of the causal horizon, topological defects
and primordial gravitational waves. We use three estimators: the information
content, the S/N statistic and the Bayesian evidence. While reionisation has
nearly no effect on the estimators, we show that taking into account the ISW
strongly decreases our ability to detect the topological signal. We also study
the impact of varying the relevant cosmological parameters within the 2 sigma
ranges allowed by present data. We find that only Omega_Lambda, which
influences both ISW and the size of the causal horizon, significantly alters
the detection for all three estimators considered here.

The research uses simulations to test the performance of various statistical methods in detecting different network topologies. The results reveal that the detectability limit depends on the complexity of the topology and the size of the network. The study concludes that statistical methods can reliably detect non-trivial topologies under certain conditions, but caution is needed when interpreting results.",True,1
"Influence of Orbital Behaviour and Chaos on the Shape of Dark Matter
  Halos","  It has been shown that the dissipative gas infall during galaxy formation has
the capability to modify the shape of dark matter halos. In this paper we
perform the first detailed analysis of particle orbits in a cosmological dark
matter halos to understand {\it how} and {\it why} baryons alter its shape. We
perform a series of numerical experiments where we grow a baryonic core inside
a live dark matter halo extracted from a cosmological simulation. We follow the
orbits of more than 300 particles with more that 50000 timesteps. Our results
clearly show that the dissipational component is responsible for repeatedly
deflecting orbits which visit often the center of the system. Moreover the
gravitational potential time dependence associated with the growth of the
baryonic mass, shifts the frequencies of the orbits, making them extremely
chaotic. This randomization makes the orbits explore a large phase space. When
this effect takes place for a significant number of orbits it will be
manifested in the density distribution as an approach to a rounder
configuration. As a consequence, the influence of the central mass on the shape
of the phase space decreases with increasing distance from the center. We
discuss the importance of future analysis of controlled experiments (i.e. using
analytic potentials instead of live DM halos) to better decipher the dynamics

D-branes as a Bubbling Calabi-Yau,"  We prove that the open topological string partition function on a D-brane

Holographic Electroweak Symmetry Breaking from D-branes,"  We observe several interesting phenomena in a technicolor-like model of

that both sides of the holographic duality are well understood. We find that
the lightest technicolor resonances contribute negatively to the
Peskin-Takeuchi S-parameter, but heavy resonances do not decouple and lead
generically to large, positive values of S, consistent with standard estimates
in QCD-like theories. We study how the S parameter and the masses and decay
constants of the vector and axial-vector techni-resonances vary over a
one-parameter family of D8-brane configurations. We discuss possibilities for

Modules over operads and functors,"  In the theory of operads we consider functors of generalized symmetric powers

right operad action, give rise to functors on categories of algebras and we
prove that this construction yields an embedding of categories. Then we check
that right modules over operads form a model category. In addition we prove
that weak-equivalences of right modules correspond to pointwise

Enhanced spin-orbit scattering length in narrow Al_xGa_{1-x}N/GaN wires,"  The magnetotransport in a set of identical parallel AlGaN/GaN quantum wire
structures was investigated. The width of the wires was ranging between 1110 nm

the same for all wires, confirming that the electron gas in the AlGaN/GaN

clearly observed, indicating the presence of spin-orbit coupling. For narrow
quantum wires with an effective electrical width below 250 nm the weak
antilocalization effect is suppressed. By comparing the experimental data to a

"Cosmological Casimir effect with maximum planckian momentum and

constant, reproduces an accelerating universe. This is done by taking into
account Casimir vacuum energy density, assuming that the underlying theory
allows a maximum momentum, that turns out to be the leading contribution term
to Einstein equations in a large expanding FRW universe. As stated in numerous

existence of the Planck length as a fundamental length. This insight, together
with the assumption of a Planck scale correction to the energy/momentum
dispersion-relation on a FRW background, is used here to calculate Casimir
vacuum energy. We show that, under these hypothesis, an accelerated universe
expansion is obtained. As last step we analyze the compatibility of the
resulting model with experimental data, writing down the equation of state for
Casimir energy and pressure and observing that this equation of state belongs
to a class of models that naturally fits cosmological observations. We
emphasize that our result relies, once a fundamental length is introduced in

  I also discuss what is known about the dissolution of star clusters in
different environments. The dissolution time can be derived from the mass and
age distributions of cluster samples. The resulting dissolution times of
clusters in the solar neighborhood (SN) and in interacting galaxies are shorter
than predicted by two-body relaxation of clusters in a tidal field. Encounters
with giant molecular clouds can explain the fate of clusters in the SN and are
the most likely cause of the short lifetime of clusters in interacting

Detection of superhumps in the VY Scl-type nova-like variable KR Aur,"  We report on detection of negative superhumps in KR Aur which is the

such models, which is common knowledge among field researchers in dengue, we
find a deterministically chaotic attractor in the more realistic parameter
region of reduced infectivity on secondary infection (''inverse ADE'' parameter

are more likely to be hospitalized, hence do not contribute to the force of
infection as much as people with first infection.
  Our finding has wider implications beyond dengue in any multi-strain

Moving gap solitons in periodic potentials,"  We address existence of moving gap solitons (traveling localized solutions)
in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a small periodic potential. Moving gap
solitons are approximated by the explicit localized solutions of the
coupled-mode system. We show however that exponentially decaying traveling
solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation do not generally exist in the
presence of a periodic potential due to bounded oscillatory tails ahead and
behind the moving solitary waves. The oscillatory tails are not accounted in
the coupled-mode formalism and are estimated by using techniques of spatial
dynamics and local center-stable manifold reductions. Existence of bounded
traveling solutions of the Gross--Pitaevskii equation with a single bump
surrounded by oscillatory tails on a finite large interval of the spatial scale
is proven by using these technique. We also show generality of oscillatory
tails in other nonlinear equations with a periodic potential.

Graphene bilayer with a twist: electronic structure,"  Electronic properties of bilayer and multilayer graphene have generally been
interpreted in terms of AB or Bernal stacking. However, it is known that many

zero energy in a continuum approximation. Contrary to what happens in a AB
stacked bilayer and in accord with observations in epitaxial graphene we find:
(a) the low energy dispersion is linear, as in a single layer, but the Fermi

Radio Lobes of Pictor A: an X-ray spatially resolved Study,"  A new XMM observation has made possible a detailed study of both lobes of the

Inverse Compton scattering of the microwave background photons by relativistic

"A quantitative study on the growth variability of tumour cell clones in
  vitro","  Objectives: In this study, we quantify the growth variability of tumour cell
clones from a human leukemia cell line. Materials and methods: We have used
microplate spectrophotometry to measure the growth kinetics of hundreds of
individual cell clones from the Molt3 cell line. The growth rate of each clonal
population has been estimated by fitting experimental data with the logistic
equation. Results: The growth rates were observed to vary among different
clones. Up to six clones with a growth rate above or below the mean growth rate
of the parent population were further cloned and the growth rates of their
offsprings were measured. The distribution of the growth rates of the subclones
did not significantly differ from that of the parent population thus suggesting
that growth variability has an epigenetic origin. To explain the observed
distributions of clonal growth rates we have developed a probabilistic model
assuming that the fluctuations in the number of mitochondria through successive
cell cycles are the leading cause of growth variability. For fitting purposes,
we have estimated experimentally by flow cytometry the maximum average number
of mitochondria in Molt3 cells. The model fits nicely the observed
distributions of growth rates, however, cells in which the mitochondria were
rendered non functional (rho-0 cells) showed only a 30% reduction in the clonal
growth variability with respect to normal cells. Conclusions: A tumor cell
population is a dynamic ensemble of clones with highly variable growth rate. At
least part of this variability is due to fluctuations in the number of
mitochondria.

Continuous Capillary Condensation,"  We show that condensation in a capped capillary slit is a continuous

Characterization of Instrumental Phase Stability,"  Atmospheric water vapor causes significant undesired phase fluctuations for
the Submillimeter Array (SMA) interferometer, particularly in its highest

The authors introduce the concept of ""pro-cyclic motivic Galois group"" and show that it plays a crucial role in understanding the motives of these fields. 
The paper presents several results and conclusions. First, the authors prove that the category of motives of perfect PAC fields with pro-cyclic Galois group is equivalent to the category of motives of certain algebraic curves. They also establish a connection between the motives of these fields and the motives of certain algebraic varieties called ""moduli spaces of Drinfeld modules."" 
Another important result of the paper is the computation of the motivic cohomology of perfect PAC fields with pro-cyclic Galois group. The authors show that this cohomology group is isomorphic to the Galois cohomology group of the field with coefficients in a certain motivic complex. 
Overall, the paper provides a deeper understanding of the algebraic structure and motives of perfect PAC fields with pro-cyclic Galois group. The results and conclusions presented in the paper can be useful in various areas of algebraic geometry and number theory.",True,1
Adjoint Functors and Heteromorphisms,"  Category theory has foundational importance because it provides conceptual
lenses to characterize what is important in mathematics. Originally the main
lenses were universal mapping properties and natural transformations. In recent
decades, the notion of adjoint functors has moved to center-stage as category
theory's primary tool to characterize what is important in mathematics. Our
focus here is to present a theory of adjoint functors. The basis for the theory
is laid by first showing that the object-to-object ""heteromorphisms"" between
the objects of different categories (e.g., insertion of generators as a set to
group map) can be rigorously treated within category theory. The heteromorphic
theory shows that all adjunctions arise from the birepresentations of the
heteromorphisms between the objects of different categories.

"Rotational Widths for Use in the Tully-Fisher Relation. II. The Impact
  of Surface Brightness","  Using a large sample of spiral galaxies for which 21 cm single-dish and/or
long-slit optical spectra are available, we make a detailed comparison between
various estimates of rotational widths. Different optical width estimators are
considered and their limitations discussed, with emphasis on biases associated
with rotation curve properties (shape and extent) and disk central surface
brightness. The best match with HI rotational velocities is obtained with
Polyex widths, which are measured at the optical radius (encompassing a fixed
fraction of the total light of the galaxy) from a model fit to the rotation
curve. In contrast with Polyex widths, optical rotational velocities measured
at 2.15 disk scale lengths r_d deviate from HI widths by an amount that
correlates with the central surface brightness of the disk. This bias occurs
because the rotation curves of galaxies are in general still rising at 2.15
r_d, and the fraction of total mass contained within this radius decreases with
increasing disk surface brightness. Statistical corrections, parameterized by
the radial extent of the observed rotation curve, are provided to reduce Polyex
and HI width measurements into a homogeneous system. This yields a single
robust estimate of rotational velocity to be used for applications of disk
scaling relations.

Observation of the Density Minimum in Deeply Supercooled Confined Water,"  Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) is used to measure the density of heavy

Front propagation into unstable metal nanowires,"  Long, cylindrical metal nanowires have recently been observed to form and be
stable for seconds at a time at room temperature. Their stability and
structural dynamics is well described by a continuum model, the nanoscale
free-electron model, which predicts cylinders in certain intervals of radius to
be linearly unstable. In this paper, I study how a small, localized
perturbation of such an unstable wire grows exponentially and propagates along
the wire with a well-defined front. The front is found to be pulled, and forms
a coherent pattern behind it. It is well described by a linear marginal
stability analysis of front propagation into an unstable state. In some cases,
nonlinearities of the wire dynamics are found to trigger an invasive mode that
pushes the front. Experimental procedures that could lead to the observation of
this phenomenon are suggested.

systems assembling their mass through mergers, but contrarily to the former
structures they do not continuously accrete external matter because they are
shielded by their host halos. Here we explore the idea that the infall of their

Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking as a Basis of Particle Mass,"  Electroweak theory joins electromagnetism with the weak force in a single
quantum field theory, ascribing the two fundamental interactions--so different
in their manifestations--to a common symmetry principle. How the electroweak
gauge symmetry is hidden is one of the most urgent and challenging questions
facing particle physics. The provisional answer incorporated in the ""standard
model"" of particle physics was formulated in the 1960s by Higgs, by Brout &
Englert, and by Guralnik, Hagen & Kibble: The agent of electroweak symmetry
breaking is an elementary scalar field whose self-interactions select a vacuum
state in which the full electroweak symmetry is hidden, leaving a residual
phase symmetry of electromagnetism. By analogy with the Meissner effect of the
superconducting phase transition, the Higgs mechanism, as it is commonly known,
confers masses on the weak force carriers W and Z. It also opens the door to
masses for the quarks and leptons, and shapes the world around us. It is a good
story--though an incomplete story--and we do not know how much of the story is
true. Experiments that explore the Fermi scale (the energy regime around 1 TeV)
during the next decade will put the electroweak theory to decisive test, and

"Squashed entanglement for multipartite states and entanglement measures

definitions of multipartite information and different methods of optimizing
over extensions of the states. One is a generalization of the squashed
entanglement where one takes the mutual information of parties conditioned on
the state's extension and takes the infimum over such extensions. Additivity of
the multipartite squashed entanglement is proved for both versions of the
multipartite information which turn out to be related. The second one is based
on taking classical extensions. This scheme is generalized, which enables to
construct measures of entanglement based on the {\it mixed convex roof} of a
quantity, which in contrast to the standard convex roof method involves
optimization over all decompositions of a density matrix rather than just the
decompositions into pure states. As one of the possible applications of these
results we prove that any multipartite monotone is an upper bound on the amount

  Application to X-ray jets in symbiotic stars","  In papers I and II in this series, we presented hydrodynamical simulations of
jet models with parameters representative of the symbiotic system MWC 560.
These were simulations of a pulsed, initially underdense jet in a high density
ambient medium. Since the pulsed emission of the jet creates internal shocks
and since the jet velocity is very high, the jet bow shock and the internal
shocks are heated to high temperatures and should therefore emit X-ray
radiation. In this paper, we investigate in detail the X-ray properties of the

its temporal variability, the resulting spectra and the spatial distribution of
the emission. Temperature and density maps from our hydrodynamical simulations

show extended and variable X-ray emission which can be characterized as a sum
of hot and warm components with temperatures that are consistent with
observations of CH Cyg and R Aqr. The X-ray spectra of our model jets show
emission line features which correspond to observed features in the spectra of
CH Cyg. The innermost parts of our pulsed jets show iron line emission in the
6.4 - 6.7 keV range which may explain such emission from the central source in

Hydrodynamic Limit for a Particle System with degenerate rates,"  We study the hydrodynamic limit for some conservative particle systems with
degenerate rates, namely with nearest neighbor exchange rates which vanish for
certain configurations. These models belong to the class of {\sl kinetically
constrained lattice gases} (KCLG) which have been introduced and intensively
studied in physics literature as simple models for the liquid/glass transition.
Due to the degeneracy of rates for KCLG there exists {\sl blocked
configurations} which do not evolve under the dynamics and in general the
hyperplanes of configurations with a fixed number of particles can be
decomposed into different irreducible sets. As a consequence, both the Entropy
and Relative Entropy method cannot be straightforwardly applied to prove the
hydrodynamic limit. In particular, some care should be put when proving the One
and Two block Lemmas which guarantee local convergence to equilibrium. We show
that, for initial profiles smooth enough and bounded away from zero and one,
the macroscopic density profile for our KCLG evolves under the diffusive time
scaling according to the porous medium equation. Then we prove the same result
for more general profiles for a slightly perturbed dynamics obtained by adding
jumps of the Symmetric Simple Exclusion. The role of the latter is to remove
the degeneracy of rates and at the same time they are properly slowed down in
order not to change the macroscopic behavior. The equilibrium fluctuations and

"Dust Formation and He II 4686 emission in the Dense Shell of the
  Peculiar Type Ib Supernova 2006jc","  We present evidence for the formation of dust grains in an unusual Type Ib SN
based on late-time spectra of SN 2006jc. The progenitor suffered an LBV-like
outburst just 2 yr earlier, and we propose that the dust formation is a
consequence of the SN blast wave overtaking that LBV-like shell. The key
evidence for dust formation is (a) the appearance of a red/near-IR continuum
source fit by 1600 K graphite grains, and (b) fading of the redshifted sides of
He I emission lines, yielding progressively more asymmetric blueshifted lines
as dust obscures receding material. This provides the strongest case yet for
dust formation in any SN Ib/c. Both developments occurred between 51 and 75 d
after peak, while other SNe observed to form dust did so after a few hundred
days. Geometric considerations indicate that dust formed in the dense swept-up
shell between the forward and reverse shocks, and not in the freely expanding
SN ejecta. Rapid cooling leading to dust formation may have been aided by
extremely high shell densities, as indicated by He I line ratios. The brief
epoch of dust formation is accompanied by He II 4686 emission and enhanced
X-ray emission. These clues suggest that the unusual dust formation in this

"Scaling Behaviors of Graphene Nanoribbon FETs: A Three Dimensional
  Quantum Simulation Study","  The scaling behaviors of graphene nanoribbon (GNR) Schottky barrier
field-effect transistors (SBFETs) are studied by solving the non-equilibrium
Green's function (NEGF) transport equation in an atomistic basis set
self-consistently with a three-dimensional Poisson equation. The armchair edge
GNR channel shares similarities with a zigzag CNT, but it has a different
geometry and quantum confinement boundary condition in the transverse
direction. The results indicate that the I-V characteristics are ambipolar and
strongly depend on the GNR width because the bandgap of the GNR is
approximately inversely proportional to its width, which agrees with recent
experiments. A multiple gate geometry improves immunity to short channel
effects, but it offers smaller improvement than it does for Si MOSFETs in terms
of the on-current and transconductance. Reducing the oxide thickness is more
useful for improving transistor performance than using a high-k gate insulator.
Significant increase of the minimal leakage current is observed when the
channel length is scaled below 10nm because the small effective mass
facilitates strong source-drain tunneling. The GNRFET, therefore, does not
promise extending the ultimate scaling limit of Si MOSFETs. The intrinsic
switching speed of a GNR SBFET, however, is several times faster than that of
Si MOSFETs, which could lead to promising high speed electronics applications,
where the large leakage of GNR SBFETs is of less concern.

Nonlinearity-assisted quantum tunneling in a matter-wave interferometer,"  We investigate the {\em nonlinearity-assisted quantum tunneling} and
formation of nonlinear collective excitations in a matter-wave interferometer,
which is realised by the adiabatic transformation of a double-well potential
into a single-well harmonic trap. In contrast to the linear quantum tunneling
induced by the crossing (or avoided crossing) of neighbouring energy levels,
the quantum tunneling between different nonlinear eigenstates is assisted by
the nonlinear mean-field interaction. When the barrier between the wells
decreases, the mean-field interaction aids quantum tunneling between the ground
and excited nonlinear eigenstates. The resulting {\em non-adiabatic evolution}
depends on the input states. The tunneling process leads to the generation of
dark solitons, and the number of the generated dark solitons is highly
sensitive to the matter-wave nonlinearity. The results of the numerical
simulations of the matter-wave dynamics are successfully interpreted with a
coupled-mode theory for multiple nonlinear eigenstates.

inside a single-mode optical cavity is discussed. We show that the degree of
entanglement and the time it takes for the entanglement to reach its optimum
value is a sensitive function the initial conditions and the position of the
atoms inside the cavity mode. It is found that the entangled properties of the
two atoms can readily be extracted from dynamics of a simple two-level system.
Effectively, we engineer two coupled qubits whose the dynamics are analogous to
that of a driven single two-level system. It is found that spatial variations
of the coupling constants actually help to create transient entanglement which
may appear on the time scale much longer than that predicted for the case of
equal coupling constants. When the atoms are initially prepared in an entangled
state, they may remain entangled for all times. We also find that the
entanglement exhibits an interesting phenomenon of diffraction when the the
atoms are located between the nodes and antinodes of the cavity mode. The
diffraction pattern of the entanglement varies with time and we explain this
effect in terms of the quantum property of complementarity, which is manifested
as a tradeoff between the knowledge of energy of the exchanged photon versus
the evolution time of the system.

"Cosmological Symmetry Breaking, Pseudo-scale invariance, Dark Energy and

energy of a slowly rolling scalar field. Making a quantum expansion around such

that it is different from the standard phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry
breaking. We illustrate this with a toy scalar field theory, whose action
displays a U(1) symmetry. We identify a symmetry, called pseudo-scale
invariance, which sets the cosmological constant exactly equal to zero, both in
classical and quantum theory. This symmetry is also broken cosmologically and
leads to a nonzero vacuum or dark energy. The slow roll condition along with
the observed value of dark energy leads to a value of the background scalar
field of the order of Planck mass. We also consider a U(1) gauge symmetry
model. Cosmological symmetry breaking, in this case, leads to a non zero mass

Sensitivity of low degree oscillations to the change in solar abundances,"  Context. The most recent determination of the solar chemical composition,
using a time-dependent, 3D hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere,

with helioseismological determinations of the sound speed profile, the surface
helium abundance and the convection zone depth. Aims. We investigate the effect
of changes of solar abundances on low degree p-mode and g-mode characteristics

very sensitive to changes in the heavy-element abundances, notably neon. We
show that by considering all the seismic constraints, including the small
frequency spacings, a rather large increase of neon abundance by about (0.5 +/-
0.05)dex can be a good solution to the discrepancy between solar models that
use new abundances and low degree helioseismology, subject to adjusting

"Quasi Equilibrium Grid Algorithm: geometric construction for model
  reduction","The research paper titled ""Quasi Equilibrium Grid Algorithm: geometric construction for model reduction"" aims to introduce a new algorithm for model reduction based on geometric construction. The algorithm, called the Quasi Equilibrium Grid Algorithm (QEGA), is designed to identify the dominant modes of a system and reduce the number of variables required to represent it accurately. 
The QEGA algorithm is based on a geometric construction that involves partitioning the state space into a grid and identifying the regions that are most important in governing the system's behavior. These regions are then used to construct a reduced model that captures the system's dominant dynamics. 
The research shows that the QEGA algorithm is effective in reducing the dimensionality of complex systems while preserving their essential features. The algorithm is tested on several benchmark problems, including the Lorenz system and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and is shown to outperform other model reduction techniques. 
Overall, the research paper concludes that the QEGA algorithm offers a promising approach to model reduction that is both efficient and accurate. The algorithm's ability to identify dominant modes and construct reduced models based on geometric construction makes it a valuable tool for a wide range of applications in science and engineering.",True,1

Reduction of boundary effects in spiral MRI experiment PROMISE,"  Magnetorotational instability (MRI) is one of the most important and most

Discrete Choices under Social Influence: Generic Properties,"  We consider a model of socially interacting individuals that make a binary
choice in a context of positive additive endogenous externalities. It
encompasses as particular cases several models from the sociology and economics
literature. We extend previous results to the case of a general distribution of
idiosyncratic preferences, called here Idiosyncratic Willingnesses to Pay
(IWP). Positive additive externalities yield a family of inverse demand curves
that include the classical downward sloping ones but also new ones with non
constant convexity. When j, the ratio of the social influence strength to the
standard deviation of the IWP distribution, is small enough, the inverse demand
is a classical monotonic (decreasing) function of the adoption rate. Even if
the IWP distribution is mono-modal, there is a critical value of j above which
the inverse demand is non monotonic, decreasing for small and high adoption
rates, but increasing within some intermediate range. Depending on the price
there are thus either one or two equilibria. Beyond this first result, we
exhibit the generic properties of the boundaries limiting the regions where the
system presents different types of equilibria (unique or multiple). These
properties are shown to depend only on qualitative features of the IWP
distribution: modality (number of maxima), smoothness and type of support
(compact or infinite). The main results are summarized as phase diagrams in the

On Predicting the Solar Cycle using Mean-Field Models,"  We discuss the difficulties of predicting the solar cycle using mean-field
models. Here we argue that these difficulties arise owing to the significant
modulation of the solar activity cycle, and that this modulation arises owing
to either stochastic or deterministic processes. We analyse the implications
for predictability in both of these situations by considering two separate
solar dynamo models. The first model represents a stochastically-perturbed flux
transport dynamo. Here even very weak stochastic perturbations can give rise to
significant modulation in the activity cycle. This modulation leads to a loss
of predictability. In the second model, we neglect stochastic effects and
assume that generation of magnetic field in the Sun can be described by a fully
deterministic nonlinear mean-field model -- this is a best case scenario for
prediction. We designate the output from this deterministic model (with
parameters chosen to produce chaotically modulated cycles) as a target
timeseries that subsequent deterministic mean-field models are required to
predict. Long-term prediction is impossible even if a model that is correct in
all details is utilised in the prediction. Furthermore, we show that even
short-term prediction is impossible if there is a small discrepancy in the
input parameters from the fiducial model. This is the case even if the
predicting model has been tuned to reproduce the output of previous cycles.
Given the inherent uncertainties in determining the transport coefficients and
nonlinear responses for mean-field models, we argue that this makes predicting
the solar cycle using the output from such models impossible.

"Density of states and supercurrent in diffusive SNS junctions: role of
  nonideal interfaces and spin-flip scattering","  We present a theoretical study of the density of states and supercurrent in
diffusive superconductor-normal metal-superconductor (SNS) junctions. In
particular, we study the influence on these two equilibrium properties of both
an arbitrary transparency of the SN interfaces and the presence of spin-flip
scattering in the normal wire. We show that the minigap that is present in the
spectrum of the diffusive wire is very sensitive to the interface transmission.
More mportantly, we show that at arbitrary transparency the minigap replaces
the Thouless energy as the relevant energy scale for the proximity effect,
determining for instance the temperature dependence of the critical current. We
also study in detail how the critical current is suppressed by the effect of
spin-flip scattering, which can be due to either magnetic impurities or, under

interspecies attraction above a critical value which depends on the vortex
quantum number. For interspecies attraction just below this critical limit
there is almost complete mixing of boson and fermion components. Such mixed and

Bounded Pushdown dimension vs Lempel Ziv information density,"  In this paper we introduce a variant of pushdown dimension called bounded
pushdown (BPD) dimension, that measures the density of information contained in
a sequence, relative to a BPD automata, i.e. a finite state machine equipped
with an extra infinite memory stack, with the additional requirement that every
input symbol only allows a bounded number of stack movements. BPD automata are
a natural real-time restriction of pushdown automata. We show that BPD
dimension is a robust notion by giving an equivalent characterization of BPD
dimension in terms of BPD compressors. We then study the relationships between
BPD compression, and the standard Lempel-Ziv (LZ) compression algorithm, and
show that in contrast to the finite-state compressor case, LZ is not universal
for bounded pushdown compressors in a strong sense: we construct a sequence
that LZ fails to compress signicantly, but that is compressed by at least a
factor 2 by a BPD compressor. As a corollary we obtain a strong separation

"Neglecting the porosity of hot-star winds can lead to underestimating
  mass-loss rates","  Context: The mass-loss rate is a key parameter of massive stars. Adequate
stellar atmosphere models are required for spectral analyses and mass-loss
determinations. Present models can only account for the inhomogeneity of
stellar winds in the approximation of small-scale structures that are optically
thin. This treatment of ``microclumping'' has led to reducing empirical
mass-loss rates by factors of two and more. Aims: Stellar wind clumps can be
optically thick in spectral lines. We investigate how this ``macroclumping''
impacts on empirical mass-loss rates. Methods: The Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR)
model atmosphere code is generalized in the ``formal integral'' to account for
clumps that are not necessarily optically thin. Results: Optically thick clumps
reduce the effective opacity. This has a pronounced effect on the emergent
spectrum. Our modeling for the O-type supergiant zeta Puppis reveals that the
optically thin H-alpha line is not affected by wind porosity, but that the PV
resonance doublet becomes significantly weaker when macroclumping is taken into
account. The reported discrepancies between resonance-line and
recombination-line diagnostics can be resolved entirely with the macroclumping
modeling without downward revision of the mass-loss rate. Conclusions:
Mass-loss rates inferred from optically thin emission, such as the H-alpha line
in O stars, are not influenced by macroclumping. The strength of optically
thick lines, however, is reduced because of the porosity effects. Therefore,
neglecting the porosity in stellar wind modeling can lead to underestimating
empirical mass-loss rates.

"Radio Spectral Evolution of an X-ray Poor Impulsive Solar Flare:
  Implications for Plasma Heating and Electron Acceleration","  We present radio and X-ray observations of an impulsive solar flare that was
moderately intense in microwaves, yet showed very meager EUV and X-ray

consideration in designing surveys for Earth-analogues. Valenti & Fischer
(2005) provide age and metallicity estimates for 1039 FGK dwarfs in the Solar
Neighbourhood. Using the Hipparcos catalogue as a reference to calibrate
potential biases, we have extracted volume-limited samples of nearby stars from
the Valenti-Fischer dataset. Unlike other recent investigations, our analysis
shows clear evidence for an age-metallicity relation in the local disk, albeit
with substantial dispersion at any epoch. The mean metallicity increases from
-0.3 dex at a lookback time of ~10 Gyrs to +0.15 dex at the present day.
Supplementing the Valenti-Fischer measurements with literature data to give a
complete volume-limited sample, the age distribution of nearby FGK dwarfs is
broadly consistent with a uniform star-formation rate over the history of the
Galactic disk. In striking contrast, most stars known to have planetary
companions are younger than 5 Gyrs; however, stars with planetary companions
within 0.4 AU have a significantly flatter age distribution, indicating that
those systems are stable on timescales of many Gyrs. Several of the older,
lower metallicity host stars have enhanced [alpha/Fe] ratios, implying
membership of the thick disk. If the frequency of terrestrial planets is also
correlated with stellar metallicity, then the median age of such planetary
system is likely to be ~3 Gyrs. We discuss the implications of this hypothesis
in designing searches for Earth analogues among the nearby stars.

Trapping and Cooling a mirror to its quantum mechanical ground state,"  We propose a technique aimed at cooling a harmonically oscillating mirror to
its quantum mechanical ground state starting from room temperature. Our method,

Testing General Metric Theories of Gravity with Bursting Neutron Stars,"  I show that several observable properties of bursting neutron stars in metric
theories of gravity can be calculated using only conservation laws, Killing

GRB blastwaves through wind-shaped circumburst media,"  Context:A significant fraction of progenitors for long gamma-ray bursts

therefore requires modeling the propagation of ultra-relativistic blastwaves
through the circumburst medium surrounding massive stars. We simulate the
expansion of an isotropic, adiabatic relativistic fireball into the wind-shaped
medium around a massive GRB progenitor. The circumburst medium is composed of a
realistically stratified stellar wind zone up to its termination shock,
followed by a region of shocked wind characterized by a constant density. Aims:
We followed the evolution of the blastwave through all its stages, including
the extremely rapid acceleration up to a Lorentz factor 75 flow, its
deceleration by interaction with stellar wind, its passage of the wind
termination shock, until its propagation through shocked wind. Methods: We used
the adaptive mesh refinement versatile advection code to follow the evolution
of the fireball. Results: We show that the acceleration from purely thermal to
ultra-relativistic kinetic regimes is abrupt and produces an internally
structured blastwave. We resolved the structure of this ultra-relativistic
shell in all stages, thanks to the adaptive mesh. We comment on the dynamical
roles played by forward and reverse shock pairs in the phase of interaction
with the free stellar wind and clearly identify the complex shock-dominated
structure created when the shell crosses the terminal shock. Conclusion: We
show that in our model where the terminal shock is taken relatively close to
the massive star, the phase of self-similar deceleration of Blandford-McKee
type can only be produced in the constant density, shocked wind zone.

Is diversity good?,"  Prominent ethical and policy issues such as affirmative action and female
enrollment in science and engineering revolve around the idea that diversity is
good. However, even though diversity is an ambiguous concept, a precise
definition is seldom provided. We show that diversity may be construed as a
factual description, a craving for symmetry, an intrinsic good, an instrumental
good, a symptom, or a side effect. These acceptions differ vastly in their
nature and properties. The first one cannot lead to any action and the second
one is mistaken. Diversity as intrinsic good is a mere opinion, which cannot be
concretely applied; moreover, the most commonly invoked forms of diversity
(sexual and racial) are not intrinsically good. On the other hand, diversity as
instrumental good can be evaluated empirically and can give rise to policies,
but these may be very weak. Finally, symptoms and side effects are not actually
about diversity. We consider the example of female enrollment in science and
engineering, interpreting the various arguments found in the literature in
light of this polysemy.

Physical Layer Network Coding,"  A main distinguishing feature of a wireless network compared with a wired
network is its broadcast nature, in which the signal transmitted by a node may
reach several other nodes, and a node may receive signals from several other
nodes simultaneously. Rather than a blessing, this feature is treated more as
an interference-inducing nuisance in most wireless networks today (e.g., IEEE
802.11). This paper shows that the concept of network coding can be applied at
the physical layer to turn the broadcast property into a capacity-boosting
advantage in wireless ad hoc networks. Specifically, we propose a
physical-layer network coding (PNC) scheme to coordinate transmissions among
nodes. In contrast to straightforward network coding which performs coding
arithmetic on digital bit streams after they have been received, PNC makes use
of the additive nature of simultaneously arriving electromagnetic (EM) waves
for equivalent coding operation. And in doing so, PNC can potentially achieve
100% and 50% throughput increases compared with traditional transmission and
straightforward network coding, respectively, in multi-hop networks. More
specifically, the information-theoretic capacity of PNC is almost double that
of traditional transmission in the SNR region of practical interest (higher
than 0dB). We believe this is a first paper that ventures into EM-wave-based
network coding at the physical layer and demonstrates its potential for
boosting network capacity.

Dark energy from modified F(R)-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity,The research paper explores the possibility of dark energy arising from modified F(R)-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity.

An experimental test of non-local realism,"  Most working scientists hold fast to the concept of 'realism' - a viewpoint
according to which an external reality exists independent of observation. But
quantum physics has shattered some of our cornerstone beliefs. According to
Bell's theorem, any theory that is based on the joint assumption of realism and
locality (meaning that local events cannot be affected by actions in space-like
separated regions) is at variance with certain quantum predictions. Experiments
with entangled pairs of particles have amply confirmed these quantum
predictions, thus rendering local realistic theories untenable. Maintaining
realism as a fundamental concept would therefore necessitate the introduction
of 'spooky' actions that defy locality. Here we show by both theory and
experiment that a broad and rather reasonable class of such non-local realistic
theories is incompatible with experimentally observable quantum correlations.
In the experiment, we measure previously untested correlations between two
entangled photons, and show that these correlations violate an inequality
proposed by Leggett for non-local realistic theories. Our result suggests that
giving up the concept of locality is not sufficient to be consistent with
quantum experiments, unless certain intuitive features of realism are
abandoned.

An experimental test of non-local realism,"This research paper presents an experimental test of non-local realism using a complex Bell inequality. The experiment involved two entangled photons and measurements performed on both photons at different locations.

These findings suggest that non-local realism cannot be reconciled with quantum mechanics, supporting the idea that entanglement is a fundamental feature of the quantum world.",True,1
Multi-Agent Approach to the Self-Organization of Networks,"  Is it possible to link a set of nodes without using preexisting positional
information or any kind of long-range attraction of the nodes? Can the process
of generating positional information, i.e. the detection of ``unknown'' nodes
and the estabishment of chemical gradients, \emph{and} the process of network
formation, i.e. the establishment of links between nodes, occur in parallel, on
a comparable time scale, as a process of co-evolution?
  The paper discusses a model where the generation of relevant information for
establishing the links between nodes results from the interaction of many
\emph{agents}, i.e. subunits of the system that are capable of performing some
activities. Their collective interaction is based on (indirect) communication,
which also includes memory effects and the dissemination of information in the
system. The relevant (``pragmatic'') information that leads to the
establishment of the links then emerges from an evolutionary interplay of

"Sunyaev-Zel'dovich profiles and scaling relations: modelling effects and
  observational biases","  We use high-resolution hydrodynamic re-simulations to investigate the
properties of the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect from galaxy clusters.
We compare results obtained using different physical models for the
intracluster medium (ICM), and show how they modify the SZ emission in terms of
cluster profiles and scaling relations. We also produce realistic mock
observations to verify whether the results from hydrodynamic simulations can be
confirmed. We find that SZ profiles depend marginally on the modelled physical
processes, while they exhibit a strong dependence on cluster mass. The central
and total SZ emission strongly correlate with the cluster X-ray luminosity and
temperature. The logarithmic slopes of these scaling relations differ from the
self-similar predictions by less than 0.2; the normalization of the relations
is lower for simulations including radiative cooling. The observational test
suggests that SZ cluster profiles are unlikely to be able to probe the ICM
physics. The total SZ decrement appears to be an observable much more robust
than the central intensity, and we suggest using the former to investigate
scaling relations.

Inferring dynamic genetic networks with low order independencies,"  In this paper, we propose a novel inference method for dynamic genetic
networks which makes it possible to face with a number of time measurements n

large p and small n estimation case, we propose to approximate DAG G by
considering low order conditional independencies. We introduce partial qth
order conditional dependence DAGs G(q) and analyze their probabilistic
properties. In general, DAGs G(q) differ from DAG G but still reflect relevant
dependence facts for sparse networks such as genetic networks. By using this

random walks on networks. We performed the calculations in two limiting cases:
in the annealed case, where the rearrangement of the random links is fast, and
in the quenched case, where the link rearrangement is slow compared to the
motion of the random walker or the surface. It has been well-established that
in a large class of interacting systems, adding an arbitrarily small density
of, possibly long-range, quenched random links to a regular lattice interaction
topology, will give rise to mean-field (or annealed) like behavior. In some

break-down can be understood by treating the random links perturbatively, where
the mean-field (or annealed) prediction appears as the lowest-order term of a
naive perturbation expansion. The asymptotic analytic results are also
confirmed numerically by employing exact numerical diagonalization of the

"CPT and lepton number violation in neutrino sector: Modified mass matrix
  and oscillation due to gravity","  We study the consequences of CPT and lepton number violation in neutrino
sector. For CPT violation we take gravity with which neutrino and antineutrino
couple differently. Gravity mixes neutrino and antineutrino in an unequal ratio
to give two mass eigenstates. Lepton number violation interaction together with
CPT violation gives rise to neutrino-antineutrino oscillation. Subsequently, we
study the neutrino flavor mixing and oscillation under the influence of
gravity. It is found that gravity changes flavor oscillation significantly
which influences the relative abundance of different flavors in present
universe. We show that the neutrinoless double beta decay rate is modified due
to presence of gravity- the origin of CPT violation, as the mass of the flavor
state is modified.

"Universal Substructure Distributions in LCDM halos: Can we find a Fossil
  Group?","  We use large cosmological N-body simulations to study the subhalo population
in galaxy group sized halos. In particular, we look for fossil group candidates
with typical masses ~10-25% of Virgo cluster but with an order of magnitude
less substructure. We examine recent claims that the earliest systems to form
are deficient enough in substructure to explain the luminosity function found
in fossil groups. Although our simulations show a correlation between the halo
formation time and the number of subhalos, the maximum suppression of subhalos
is a factor of 2-2.5, whereas a factor of 6 is required to match fossil groups
and galaxies. While the number of subhalos depends weakly on the formation
time, the slope of the halo substructure velocity function does not. The
satellite population within Cold Dark Matter (CDM) halos is self-similar at
scales between galaxies and galaxy clusters regardless of mass, whereas current
observations show a break in self-similarity at a mass scale corresponding to

Mapping the Cosmological Confidence Ball Surface,"  We present a new technique to compute simultaneously valid confidence
intervals for a set of model parameters. We apply our method to the Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe's (WMAP) Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data,
exploring a seven dimensional space (tau, Omega_DE, Omega_M, omega_DM, omega_B,
f_nu, n_s). We find two distinct regions-of-interest: the standard Concordance
Model, and a region with large values of omega_DM, omega_B and H_0. This second
peak in parameter space can be rejected by applying a constraint (or a prior)
on the allowable values of the Hubble constant. Our new technique uses a
non-parametric fit to the data, along with a frequentist approach and a smart
search algorithm to map out a statistical confidence surface. The result is a
confidence ``ball'': a set of parameter values that contains the true value
with probability at least 1-alpha. Our algorithm performs a role similar to the
often used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which samples from the posterior
probability function in order to provide Bayesian credible intervals on the
parameters. While the MCMC approach samples densely around a peak in the
posterior, our new technique allows cosmologists to perform efficient analyses
around any regions of interest: e.g., the peak itself, or, possibly more
importantly, the 1-alpha confidence surface.

"WHAM: A WENO-based general relativistic numerical scheme I:
  Hydrodynamics","  Active galactic nuclei, x-ray binaries, pulsars, and gamma-ray bursts are all
believed to be powered by compact objects surrounded by relativistic plasma
flows driving phenomena such as accretion, winds, and jets. These flows are
often accurately modelled by the relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)
approximation. Time-dependent numerical MHD simulations have proven to be
especially insightful, but one regime that remains difficult to simulate is
when the energy scales (kinetic, thermal, magnetic) within the plasma become
disparate. We develop a numerical scheme that significantly improves the
accuracy and robustness of the solution in this regime. We use a modified form
of the WENO method to construct a finite-volume general relativistic
hydrodynamics code called WHAM that converges at fifth order. We avoid (1)
field-by-field decomposition by adaptively reducing down to 2-point stencils
near discontinuities for a more accurate treatment of shocks, and (2) excessive
reduction to low order stencils, as in the standard WENO formalism, by
maintaining high order accuracy in smooth monotonic flows. Our scheme performs
the proper surface integral of the fluxes, converts cell averaged conserved
quantities to point conserved quantities before performing the reconstruction
step, and correctly averages all source terms. We demonstrate that the scheme
is robust in strong shocks, very accurate in smooth flows, and maintains
accuracy even when the energy scales in the flow are highly disparate.

Statistical Behavior Of Domain Systems,"  We study the statistical behavior of two out of equilibrium systems. The
first one is a quasi one-dimensional gas with two species of particles under
the action of an external field which drives each species in opposite

size distribution of the gas and the spin systems is well fitted by the Wigner

Experimental studies on vacancy induced ferromagnetism in undoped TiO2,"  Room temperature ferromagnetism is observed in undoped TiO2 films deposited
on Si substrates using pulsed laser deposition (PLD). The ferromagnetic

oxygen 1s core peak from x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) suggests the
presence of oxygen vacancies in these samples. The amount of oxygen during the
synthesis determines the vacancy concentration in the samples which is directly
related to the magnetic behavior of the samples. The magnetic moment decreases
with oxygen vacancy concentration in the samples. Valence band measurements

In the cases of no atmospheric effects, the light curves contain the
information of the black hole spin because most of the X-ray photons around 1
keV usually come from the blueshifted part of the accretion flow near the black
hole shadow, and the size and the position of the black hole shadow depend on
the spin. In these cases, when most of the emission comes from the vicinity of
the event horizon, the light curves become asymmetric at ingress and egress. We
next investigate the atmospheric absorption and scattering effects of the
companion stars. By using the solar-type atmospheric model, we have taken into
account the atmospheric effects of the companion star, such as the
photoionization by HI and HeI. We found that the eclipsing light curves
observed at 1 keV possibly contain the information of the black hole spin.
However, in our atmospheric model, the effects of the atmosphere are much
larger than the effects of the black hole spin. Therefore, even in the case
that the light curves contain the information of the black hole spin, it may be
difficult to extract the information of the black hole spin if we do not have
the realistic atmospheric profiles, such as the temperature, and the number
densities for several elements. Even in such cases, the light-curve asymmetries
due to the rotation of the accretion disc exist. Only when we have the reliable
atmospheric model, in principle, the information of the strong-gravity regions,
such as the black hole spin, can be obtained from the eclipsing light curves.

Prospects for making polar molecules with microwave fields,"  We propose a new mechanism to produce ultracold polar molecules with

different species into vibrationally excited molecules by a single microwave

magnetic-field Feshbach resonances our method does not rely on the structure

addition, we determine conditions for optimal creation of polar molecules in
vibrationally excited states of the ground-state potential by changing
frequency and intensity of the microwave field. We also explore the possibility

Flavour-Dependent Type II Leptogenesis,"  We reanalyse leptogenesis via the out-of-equilibrium decay of the lightest

investigate bounds on the flavour-specific decay asymmetries, on the mass of
the lightest right-handed neutrino and on the reheat temperature of the early
universe, and compare them to the corresponding bounds in the type I seesaw

"Measuring energy dependent polarization in soft gamma-rays using Compton

astrophysical sources, foremost giving information about their geometry,
magnetic fields, and radiation mechanisms. However, very few X-ray polarization
measurements have been made, and then only mono-energetic detections, whilst
several objects are assumed to have energy dependent polarization signatures.
In this paper we investigate whether detection of energy dependent polarization

using chi-square statistics. We can reject constant polarization, with energy,
for the Cygnus X-1 spectrum (in the hard state), if the reflected component is
assumed to be completely polarized, whereas the distinction cannot be made for
weaker polarization. For the accreting pulsar, constant polarization can be

"Analytical evaluation of the X-ray scattering contribution to imaging
  degradation in grazing-incidence X-ray telescopes","  The focusing performance of X-ray optics (conveniently expressed in terms of
HEW, Half Energy Width) strongly depend on both mirrors deformations and photon
scattering caused by the microroughness of reflecting surfaces. In particular,
the contribution of X-ray Scattering (XRS) to the HEW of the optic is usually
an increasing function H(E) of the photon energy E. Therefore, in future hard
X-ray imaging telescopes of the future (SIMBOL-X, NeXT, Constellation-X, XEUS),
the X-ray scattering could be the dominant problem since they will operate also
in the hard X-ray band (i.e. beyond 10 keV). [...]
  Several methods were proposed in the past years to estimate the scattering
contribution to the HEW, dealing with the surface microroughness expressed in
terms of its Power Spectral Density (PSD), on the basis of the well-established
theory of X-ray scattering from rough surfaces. We faced that problem on the
basis on the same theory, but we tried a new approach: the direct, analytical
translation of a given surface roughness PSD into a H(E) trend, and - vice
versa - the direct translation of a H(E) requirement into a surface PSD. This
PSD represents the maximum tolerable microroughness level in order to meet the
H(E) requirement in the energy band of a given X-ray telescope.
  We have thereby found a new, analytical and widely applicable formalism to
compute the XRS contribution to the HEW from the surface PSD, provided that the
PSD had been measured in a wide range of spatial frequencies. The inverse
problem was also solved, allowing the immediate evaluation of the mirror
surface PSD from a measured function H(E). The same formalism allows
establishing the maximum allowed PSD of the mirror in order to fulfill a given
H(E) requirement. [...]

High-resolution study of a star-forming cluster in the Cep-A HW2 region,"  Due to its relatively small distance (725 pc), the Cepheus A East

methyl cyanide (CH3CN) and silicon monoxide (SiO), towards the HW2 position. On
the 1-arcsecond (about 725 AU) scale, the flattened distribution of molecular
gas around HW2 appears to be due to the projected superposition, on the plane

for all kinds of devices from molecular conductors to carbon nanotubes to
silicon transistors covering different transport regimes from the ballistic to
the diffusive limit. In this talk I use a simple version of this model to
analyze a specially designed device that could be called an electronic
Maxwell's demon, one that lets electrons go preferentially in one direction
over another. My objective is to illustrate the fundamental role of contacts
and demons in transport and energy conversion. The discussion is kept at an
academic level steering clear of real world details, but the illustrative
devices we use are very much within the capabilities of present-day technology.
For example, recent experiments on thermoelectric effects in molecular
conductors agree well with the predictions from our model. The Maxwell's demon
device itself is very similar to the pentalayer spin-torque device which has
been studied by a number of groups though we are not aware of any discussion of
the possibility of using the device as a nanoscale heat engine or as a
refrigerator as proposed here. However, my objective is not to evaluate
possible practical applications. Rather it is to introduce a simple transparent
model showing how out-of-equibrium demons suitably incorporated into
nanodevices can achieve energy conversion.

A Systematic Scan for 7-colourings of the Grid,"  We study the mixing time of a systematic scan Markov chain for sampling from
the uniform distribution on proper 7-colourings of a finite rectangular
sub-grid of the infinite square lattice, the grid. A systematic scan Markov
chain cycles through finite-size subsets of vertices in a deterministic order
and updates the colours assigned to the vertices of each subset. The systematic
scan Markov chain that we present cycles through subsets consisting of 2x2
sub-grids and updates the colours assigned to the vertices using a procedure
known as heat-bath. We give a computer-assisted proof that this systematic scan
Markov chain mixes in O(log n) scans, where n is the size of the rectangular
sub-grid. We make use of a heuristic to compute required couplings of
colourings of 2x2 sub-grids. This is the first time the mixing time of a
systematic scan Markov chain on the grid has been shown to mix for less than 8

"Thin elastic shells with variable thickness for lithospheric flexure of
  one-plate planets","  Planetary topography can either be modeled as a load supported by the
lithosphere, or as a dynamical effect due to lithospheric flexure caused by
mantle convection. In both cases the response of the lithosphere to external
forces can be calculated with the theory of thin elastic plates or shells. On
one-plate planets the spherical geometry of the lithospheric shell plays an
important role in the flexure mechanism. So far the equations governing the
deformations and stresses of a spherical shell have only been derived under the
assumption of a shell of constant thickness. However local studies of gravity
and topography data suggest large variations in the thickness of the
lithosphere. In this article we obtain the scalar flexure equations governing
the deformations of a thin spherical shell with variable thickness or variable
Young's modulus. The resulting equations can be solved in succession, except
for a system of two simultaneous equations, the solutions of which are the
transverse deflection and an associated stress function. In order to include
bottom loading generated by mantle convection, we extend the method of stress
functions to include loads with a toroidal tangential component. We further
show that toroidal tangential displacement always occurs if the shell thickness
varies, even in the absence of toroidal loads. We finally prove that the
degree-one harmonic components of the transverse deflection and of the toroidal
tangential displacement are independent of the elastic properties of the shell
and are associated with translational and rotational freedom. The flexure
equations for a shell of variable thickness are useful not only for the
prediction of the gravity signal in local admittance studies, but also for the
construction of stress maps in tectonic analysis.

Detection of single electron spin resonance in a double quantum dot,"  Spin-dependent transport measurements through a double quantum dot are a

gap collapses to zero precisely at the Heisenberg symmetry point, leading to

"Temperature-driven transition from the Wigner Crystal to the
  Bond-Charge-Density Wave in the Quasi-One-Dimensional Quarter-Filled band","  It is known that within the interacting electron model Hamiltonian for the
one-dimensional 1/4-filled band, the singlet ground state is a Wigner crystal
only if the nearest neighbor electron-electron repulsion is larger than a
critical value. We show that this critical nearest neighbor Coulomb interaction
is different for each spin subspace, with the critical value decreasing with
increasing spin. As a consequence, with the lowering of temperature, there can
occur a transition from a Wigner crystal charge-ordered state to a spin-Peierls
state that is a Bond-Charge-Density Wave with charge occupancies different from
the Wigner crystal. This transition is possible because spin excitations from
the spin-Peierls state in the 1/4-filled band are necessarily accompanied by
changes in site charge densities. We apply our theory to the 1/4-filled band
quasi-one-dimensional organic charge-transfer solids in general and to 2:1
tetramethyltetrathiafulvalene (TMTTF) and tetramethyltetraselenafulvalene
(TMTSF) cationic salts in particular. We believe that many recent experiments
strongly indicate the Wigner crystal to Bond-Charge-Density Wave transition in
several members of the TMTTF family. We explain the occurrence of two different
antiferromagnetic phases but a single spin-Peierls state in the generic phase
diagram for the 2:1 cationic solids. The antiferromagnetic phases can have
either the Wigner crystal or the Bond-Charge-Spin-Density Wave charge

characteristics of the GRB flow translate into changing gamma-ray spectra from
the photosphere of the flow. The photospheric interpretation of the GRB
emission explains the observed narrowing of GRB pulses with increasing photon

Stochastic fluctuations in metabolic pathways,"  Fluctuations in the abundance of molecules in the living cell may affect its
growth and well being. For regulatory molecules (e.g., signaling proteins or
transcription factors), fluctuations in their expression can affect the levels
of downstream targets in a network. Here, we develop an analytic framework to

Specifically, we focus on the metabolic network, which is highly inter-linked,
and noise properties may constrain its structure and function. Motivated by the
analogy between the dynamics of a linear metabolic pathway and that of the
exactly soluable linear queueing network or, alternatively, a mass transfer
system, we derive a plethora of results concerning fluctuations in the
abundance of intermediate metabolites in various common motifs of the metabolic
network. For all but one case examined, we find the steady-state fluctuation in
different nodes of the pathways to be effectively uncorrelated. Consequently,
fluctuations in enzyme levels only affect local properties and do not propagate
elsewhere into metabolic networks, and intermediate metabolites can be freely
shared by different reactions. Our approach may be applicable to study
metabolic networks with more complex topologies, or protein signaling networks
which are governed by similar biochemical reactions. Possible implications for
bioinformatic analysis of metabolimic data are discussed.

separation of so-called nonflow (mainly minijets) from flow. We extend the
Fourier-transform description of azimuth structure to include power spectra and
autocorrelations related by the Wiener-Khintchine theorem. We analyze several
examples of conventional flow analysis in that context and question the
relevance of reaction plane estimation to flow analysis. We introduce the 2D
angular autocorrelation with examples from data analysis and describe a
simulation exercise which demonstrates precise separation of flow and nonflow
using the 2D autocorrelation method. We show that an alternative correlation
measure based on Pearson's normalized covariance provides a more intuitive
measure of azimuth structure.

Exploiting Social Annotation for Automatic Resource Discovery,"  Information integration applications, such as mediators or mashups, that
require access to information resources currently rely on users manually
discovering and integrating them in the application. Manual resource discovery
is a slow process, requiring the user to sift through results obtained via
keyword-based search. Although search methods have advanced to include evidence
from document contents, its metadata and the contents and link structure of the
referring pages, they still do not adequately cover information sources --
often called ``the hidden Web''-- that dynamically generate documents in
response to a query. The recently popular social bookmarking sites, which allow
users to annotate and share metadata about various information sources, provide
rich evidence for resource discovery. In this paper, we describe a
probabilistic model of the user annotation process in a social bookmarking
system del.icio.us. We then use the model to automatically find resources
relevant to a particular information domain. Our experimental results on data
obtained from \emph{del.icio.us} show this approach as a promising method for
helping automate the resource discovery task.

Personalizing Image Search Results on Flickr,"  The social media site Flickr allows users to upload their photos, annotate
them with tags, submit them to groups, and also to form social networks by
adding other users as contacts. Flickr offers multiple ways of browsing or
searching it. One option is tag search, which returns all images tagged with a
specific keyword. If the keyword is ambiguous, e.g., ``beetle'' could mean an
insect or a car, tag search results will include many images that are not
relevant to the sense the user had in mind when executing the query. We claim
that users express their photography interests through the metadata they add in
the form of contacts and image annotations. We show how to exploit this
metadata to personalize search results for the user, thereby improving search
performance. First, we show that we can significantly improve search precision
by filtering tag search results by user's contacts or a larger social network
that includes those contact's contacts. Secondly, we describe a probabilistic
model that takes advantage of tag information to discover latent topics
contained in the search results. The users' interests can similarly be
described by the tags they used for annotating their images. The latent topics
found by the model are then used to personalize search results by finding
images on topics that are of interest to the user.

"Carbon Nanotube Thin Film Field Emitting Diode: Understanding the System
  Response Based on Multiphysics Modeling","  In this paper, we model the evolution and self-assembly of randomly oriented
carbon nanotubes (CNTs), grown on a metallic substrate in the form of a thin
film for field emission under diode configuration. Despite high output, the
current in such a thin film device often decays drastically. The present paper
is focused on understanding this problem. A systematic, multiphysics based

Demographics of Transition Objects,"  The unusual properties of transition objects (young stars with an optically
thin inner disc surrounded by an optically thick outer disc) suggest that
significant disc evolution has occured in these systems. We explore the nature
of these systems by examining their demographics, specifically their stellar
accretion rates (Mdot) and disc masses (Mdisc) compared to those of accreting T
Tauri stars of comparable age. We find that transition objects in Taurus occupy
a restricted region of the Mdot vs. Mdisc plane. Compared to non-transition
single stars in Taurus, they have stellar accretion rates that are typically
~10 times lower at the same disc mass and median disc masses ~4 times larger.
These properties are anticipated by several proposed planet formation theories
and suggest that the formation of Jovian mass planets may play a significant
role in explaining the origin of at least some transition objects. Considering
transition objects as a distinct demographic group among accreting T Tauri
stars leads to a tighter relationship between disc masses and stellar accretion
rates, with a slope between the two quantities that is close to the value of
unity expected in simple theories of disc accretion.

Demographics of Transition Objects,"The research paper titled ""Demographics of Transition Objects"" aims to explore the factors that influence the use of transitional objects (TOs) in childhood, such as age, gender, family structure, and cultural background. The study involved 262 participants, which consisted of preschool and school-aged children from diverse backgrounds.
The study found that the use of TOs was common among children, with 70% of participants reporting having a TO at some point in their childhood. The most common TOs were blankets, stuffed animals, and dolls. The study also revealed that the use of TOs was more prevalent in younger children, with a decline in usage as children grew older. Gender and family structure did not have a significant impact on the use of TOs, but cultural background did play a role, with children from non-Western cultures more likely to use TOs.
The paper concludes that TOs serve as a coping mechanism for children, helping them to feel secure and comforted during times of stress or anxiety. The study provides valuable insights into the demographics of TO use and highlights the importance of considering cultural differences when studying childhood behaviors.

The study uses a theoretical model to analyze the behavior of light pulses in a quantum well structure with spatial dispersion.
The researchers found that the dispersion of light in space can significantly affect the shape of light pulses in a quantum well.

A User-Friendly Code to Diagnose Chromospheric Plasmas,"This research paper aims to develop a user-friendly code to diagnose chromospheric plasmas.

Scaling anomaly in cosmic string background,"  We show that the classical scale symmetry of a particle moving in cosmic
string background is broken upon inequivalent quantization of the classical
system, leading to anomaly. The consequence of this anomaly is the formation of
single bound state in the coupling interval \gamma\in(-1,1). The inequivalent
quantization is characterized by a 1-parameter family of self-adjoint extension
parameter \omega. It has been conjectured that the formation of loosely bound

scattering cross section for the particles, which is usually seen in molecular
physics.

well-defined sample of highly X-ray dominated BL Lacertae objects (HBLs) which
includes 150 sources. In this paper, the third of the series, we report the
results of a dedicated optical spectroscopy campaign that, together with
results from other independent optical follow up programs, led to the
spectroscopic identification of all sources in the sample. We carried out a
systematic spectroscopic campaign for the observation of all unidentified

BL Lac objects. Our data allowed us to determined 36 redshifts out of the 50
new BL Lacs and 5 new redshifts for the previously known objects. The redshift
distribution of the complete sample is presented and compared with that of
other BL Lacs samples. For 26 sources without recognizable absorption features,
we calculated lower limits to the redshift using a method based on simulated

"Detection of a 1258 Hz high-amplitude kilohertz quasi-periodic
  oscillation in the ultra-compact X-ray binary 1A 1246-588","  We have observed the ultra-compact low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) 1A 1246-588
with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). In this manuscript we report the
discovery of a kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in 1A 1246-588. The
kilohertz QPO was only detected when the source was in a soft high-flux state
reminiscent of the lower banana branch in atoll sources. Only one kilohertz QPO
peak is detected at a relatively high frequency of 1258+-2 Hz and at a single
trial significance of more than 7 sigma. Kilohertz QPOs with a higher frequency
have only been found on two occasions in 4U 0614+09. Furthermore, the frequency
is higher than that found for the lower kilohertz QPO in any source, strongly
suggesting that the QPO is the upper of the kilohertz QPO pair often found in
LMXBs. The full-width at half maximum is 25+-4 Hz, making the coherence the
highest found for an upper kilohertz QPO. From a distance estimate of ~6 kpc
from a radius expansion burst we derive that 1A 1246-588 is at a persistent
flux of ~0.2-0.3 per cent of the Eddington flux, hence 1A 1246-588 is one of
the weakest LMXBs for which a kilohertz QPO has been detected. The
root-mean-square (rms) amplitude in the 5-60 keV band is 27+-3 per cent, this
is the highest for any kilohertz QPO source so far, in line with the general
anti-correlation between source luminosity and rms amplitude of the kilohertz
QPO peak identified before. Using the X-ray spectral information we produce a
colour-colour diagram. The source behaviour in this diagram provides further
evidence for the atoll nature of the source.

Surface gap solitons at a nonlinearity interface,"  We demonstrate existence of waves localized at the interface of two nonlinear

Information Theoretic Proofs of Entropy Power Inequalities,"  While most useful information theoretic inequalities can be deduced from the
basic properties of entropy or mutual information, up to now Shannon's entropy
power inequality (EPI) is an exception: Existing information theoretic proofs
of the EPI hinge on representations of differential entropy using either Fisher
information or minimum mean-square error (MMSE), which are derived from de
Bruijn's identity. In this paper, we first present an unified view of these
proofs, showing that they share two essential ingredients: 1) a data processing
argument applied to a covariance-preserving linear transformation; 2) an
integration over a path of a continuous Gaussian perturbation. Using these
ingredients, we develop a new and brief proof of the EPI through a mutual
information inequality, which replaces Stam and Blachman's Fisher information
inequality (FII) and an inequality for MMSE by Guo, Shamai and Verd\'u used in
earlier proofs. The result has the advantage of being very simple in that it
relies only on the basic properties of mutual information. These ideas are then
generalized to various extended versions of the EPI: Zamir and Feder's
generalized EPI for linear transformations of the random variables, Takano and
Johnson's EPI for dependent variables, Liu and Viswanath's

Jeans instability of a galactic disk embedded in a live dark halo,"  We investigate the Jeans instability of a galactic disk embedded in a

"Subdiffusion and weak ergodicity breaking in the presence of a reactive

a reactive boundary with finite reaction rate. Molecular crowding conditions,
that are found to cause subdiffusion of larger molecules in biological cells,
are shown to effect long-tailed distributions with identical exponent for both
the unbinding times from the boundary to the bulk and the rebinding times from
the bulk. This causes a weak ergodicity breaking: typically, an individual
particle either stays bound or remains in the bulk for very long times. We

particles is a relativistic invariant being the same for all corresponding
observers. Also the phase of the electromagnetic waves transporting energy at

"On the Mapping of Time-Dependent Densities onto Potentials in Quantum
  Mechanics","  The mapping of time-dependent densities on potentials in quantum mechanics is
critically examined. The issue is of significance ever since Runge and Gross
(Phys. Rev. Lett. 52, 997 (1984)) established the uniqueness of the mapping,
forming a theoretical basis for time-dependent density functional theory. We
argue that besides existence (so called v-representability) and uniqueness
there is an important question of stability and chaos. Studying a 2-level
system we find innocent, almost constant densities that cannot be constructed
from any potential (non-existence). We further show via a Lyapunov analysis
that the mapping of densities on potentials has chaotic regions in this case.
In real space the situation is more subtle. V-representability is formally
assured but the mapping is often chaotic making the actual construction of the
potential almost impossible. The chaotic nature of the mapping, studied for the

Chiral Mechanisms Leading to Orbital Quantum Structures in the Nucleon,"  Color confinement and chiral symmetry specify some important territory for
the study of hadronic physics. Any hadron can be defined as a color-singlet
composite system of qurks and gluons, the fundamental fields of qcd, while the
landscape of the hadronic spectrum is dominated by the fact that two quark
flavors, u and d, are characterized by masses small compared to the fundamental

the color constituents of the nucleon display the interplay of chiral dynamics
and confinement in a unique manner. This pageant can be explored by an
evaluation, within the context of the Georgi-Manohar chiral quark model, of the
normalization of the orbital structure functions and the normalization of the
Boer-Mulders functions for different quark flavors. The resolution structures

Intrinsic ripples in graphene,"  The stability of two-dimensional (2D) layers and membranes is subject of a
long standing theoretical debate. According to the so called Mermin-Wagner
theorem, long wavelength fluctuations destroy the long-range order for 2D
crystals. Similarly, 2D membranes embedded in a 3D space have a tendency to be
crumpled. These dangerous fluctuations can, however, be suppressed by
anharmonic coupling between bending and stretching modes making that a
two-dimensional membrane can exist but should present strong height
fluctuations. The discovery of graphene, the first truly 2D crystal and the
recent experimental observation of ripples in freely hanging graphene makes
these issues especially important. Beside the academic interest, understanding
the mechanisms of stability of graphene is crucial for understanding electronic
transport in this material that is attracting so much interest for its unusual
Dirac spectrum and electronic properties. Here we address the nature of these
height fluctuations by means of straightforward atomistic Monte Carlo
simulations based on a very accurate many-body interatomic potential for
carbon. We find that ripples spontaneously appear due to thermal fluctuations
with a size distribution peaked around 70 \AA which is compatible with
experimental findings (50-100 \AA) but not with the current understanding of
stability of flexible membranes. This unexpected result seems to be due to the

"Tests of Bayesian Model Selection Techniques for Gravitational Wave
  Astronomy","  The analysis of gravitational wave data involves many model selection

"A Cascade Model for Particle Concentration and Enstrophy in Fully

methods on up to 512**3 computional grid points. DNS results for particle
concentration and enstrophy at Taylor microscale Reynolds numbers in the range
34 - 170 were used to directly determine multiplier distributions (PDFs) on
spatial scales 3 times the Kolmogorov length scale. The width of the PDFs,
which is a measure of intermittency, decreases with increasing mass loading
within the local region where the multipliers are measured. The functional form
of this dependence is not sensitive to Reynolds numbers in the range
considered. A partition correlation probability is included in the cascade
model to account for the observed spatial anticorrelation between particle
concentration and enstrophy. Joint probability distribution functions of
concentration and enstrophy generated using the cascade model are shown to be
in excellent agreement with those derived directly from our 3D simulations.
Probabilities predicted by the cascade model are presented at Reynolds numbers

"Gauge invariance in gravity-like descriptions of massive gauge field
  theories","The research paper discusses the concept of gauge invariance in gravity-like descriptions of massive gauge field theories. Gauge invariance is a fundamental principle in physics that states that the physical laws should remain the same even when the gauge is changed. The paper explores the impact of massive gauge fields on gauge invariance and the resulting gravitational interactions. The research concludes that gravity-like descriptions of massive gauge field theories can be made gauge invariant by introducing a scalar field that couples to the gauge fields. This coupling allows for the existence of a mass term without breaking the gauge symmetry, leading to consistent gravitational interactions.

What is the order of 2D polymer escape transition?,"  An end-grafted flexible polymer chain in 3d space between two pistons
undergoes an abrupt transition from a confined coil to a flower-like
conformation when the number of monomers in the chain, N, reaches a critical
value. In 2d geometry, excluded volume interactions between monomers of a chain
confined inside a strip of finite length 2L transform the coil conformation
into a linear string of blobs. However, the blob picture raises questions on
the nature of this escape transition. To check the theoretical predictions

"How Mergers May Affect The Mass Scaling Relations Between Black Holes,
  Galaxies, and Other Gravitationally Bound Systems","  Supermassive black hole (BH) masses (MBH) are strongly correlated with galaxy
stellar bulge masses (Mbulge) and there are several ideas to explain the origin
of this relationship. This study isolates the role of galaxy mergers from
considerations of other detailed physics to more clearly show how a linear
BH-galaxy mass relation (MBH-Mgal) can naturally emerge regardless of how
primordial BHs were seeded inside galaxies, if the galaxy mass function
declines with increasing mass. Under this circumstance, the MBH-Mgal relation
is a passive attractor that eventually converges to a tight linear relation
because of two basic statistical effects: a central limit-like tendency for
galaxy mergers which is much stronger for major mergers than minor mergers, and
a convergence toward a linear relation that is due mainly to minor mergers. A
curious consequence of this thought experiment is that, if galaxy bulges are
formed by major mergers, then merging statistics naturally show that MBH would
correlate more strongly with bulge dominated galaxies, because of stronger
central-seeking tendencies, than with disk dominated galaxies. Even if some
other physics is ultimately responsible for causing a linear MBH-Mbulge
relationship, this thought experiment shows that, counter to intuition, random
merging of galaxies that harbor random BH masses tends to strengthen rather
than weaken a pre-existing, linear, correlation. This idea may be generalized
to other gravitationally bound systems (dark matter halo, compact nuclear
objects) that retain their physical identities after experiencing mergers.

"Orbital-Free Density Functional Theory: Kinetic Potentials and Ab-Initio
  Local Pseudopotentials","  In the density functional (DF) theory of Kohn and Sham, the kinetic energy of
the ground state of a system of noninteracting electrons in a general external
field is calculated using a set of orbitals. Orbital free methods attempt to
calculate this directly from the electron density by approximating the
universal but unknown kinetic energy density functional. However simple local
approximations are inaccurate and it has proved very difficult to devise
generally accurate nonlocal approximations. We focus instead on the kinetic
potential, the functional derivative of the kinetic energy DF, which appears in
the Euler equation for the electron density. We argue that the kinetic
potential is more local and more amenable to simple physically motivated
approximations in many relevant cases, and describe two pathways by which the
value of the kinetic energy can be efficiently calculated. We propose two
nonlocal orbital free kinetic potentials that reduce to known exact forms for
both slowly varying and rapidly varying perturbations and also reproduce exact
results for the linear response of the density of the homogeneous system to
small perturbations. A simple and systematic approach for generating accurate

"Evolution favors protein mutational robustness in sufficiently large
  populations","  BACKGROUND: An important question is whether evolution favors properties such
as mutational robustness or evolvability that do not directly benefit any
individual, but can influence the course of future evolution. Functionally
similar proteins can differ substantially in their robustness to mutations and
capacity to evolve new functions, but it has remained unclear whether any of
these differences might be due to evolutionary selection for these properties.
  RESULTS: Here we use laboratory experiments to demonstrate that evolution
favors protein mutational robustness if the evolving population is sufficiently
large. We neutrally evolve cytochrome P450 proteins under identical selection
pressures and mutation rates in populations of different sizes, and show that
proteins from the larger and thus more polymorphic population tend towards
higher mutational robustness. Proteins from the larger population also evolve
greater stability, a biophysical property that is known to enhance both
mutational robustness and evolvability. The excess mutational robustness and
stability is well described by existing mathematical theories, and can be
quantitatively related to the way that the proteins occupy their neutral
network.
  CONCLUSIONS: Our work is the first experimental demonstration of the general
tendency of evolution to favor mutational robustness and protein stability in
highly polymorphic populations. We suggest that this phenomenon may contribute
to the mutational robustness and evolvability of viruses and bacteria that
exist in large populations.

single photonic qubits in the measurement process. These schemes have a low
initial success probability and low detector efficiencies cause a serious
blowup in resources. In contrast, our approach uses continuous variables and
highly efficient measurements. We present a two-qubit scheme, with a simple
homodyne measurement system yielding an entangling operation with success
probability 1/2. Then we extend this to a three-qubit interaction, increasing
this probability to 3/4. We discuss the important issues of the overhead cost
and the time scaling, showing how these can be vastly improved with access to
this new probability range.

"The Loewner driving function of trajectory arcs of quadratic

On the measurement problem for a two-level quantum system,"  A geometric approach to quantum mechanics with unitary evolution and
non-unitary collapse processes is developed. In this approach the Schrodinger
evolution of a quantum system is a geodesic motion on the space of states of
the system furnished with an appropriate Riemannian metric. The measuring
device is modeled by a perturbation of the metric. The process of measurement
is identified with a geodesic motion of state of the system in the perturbed
metric. Under the assumption of random fluctuations of the perturbed metric,
the Born rule for probabilities of collapse is derived. The approach is applied
to a two-level quantum system to obtain a simple geometric interpretation of
quantum commutators, the uncertainty principle and Planck's constant. In light
of this, a lucid analysis of the double-slit experiment with collapse and an
experiment on a pair of entangled particles is presented.

R-matrices in Rime,"  We replace the ice Ansatz on matrix solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation by
a weaker condition which we call ""rime"". Rime solutions include the standard
Drinfeld-Jimbo R-matrix. Solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation within the rime
Ansatz which are maximally different from the standard one we call ""strict
rime"". A strict rime non-unitary solution is parameterized by a projective
vector. We show that this solution transforms to the Cremmer-Gervais R-matrix
by a change of basis with a matrix containing symmetric functions in the
components of the parameterizing vector. A strict unitary solution (the rime
Ansatz is well adapted for taking a unitary limit) is shown to be equivalent to
a quantization of a classical ""boundary"" r-matrix of Gerstenhaber and
Giaquinto. We analyze the structure of the elementary rime blocks and find, as
a by-product, that all non-standard R-matrices of GL(1|1)-type can be uniformly
described in a rime form.
  We discuss then connections of the classical rime solutions with the Bezout
operators. The Bezout operators satisfy the (non-)homogeneous associative
classical Yang--Baxter equation which is related to the Rota-Baxter operators.
  We classify the rime Poisson brackets: they form a 3-dimensional pencil. A
normal form of each individual member of the pencil depends on the discriminant
of a certain quadratic polynomial. We also classify orderable quadratic rime
associative algebras.
  For the standard Drinfeld-Jimbo solution, there is a choice of the
multiparameters, for which it can be non-trivially rimed. However, not every
Belavin-Drinfeld triple admits a choice of the multiparameters for which it can
be rimed. We give a minimal example.

Inferring periodic orbits from spectra of simple shaped micro-lasers,"  Dielectric micro-cavities are widely used as laser resonators and
characterizations of their spectra are of interest for various applications. We
experimentally investigate micro-lasers of simple shapes (Fabry-Perot, square,
pentagon, and disk). Their lasing spectra consist mainly of almost equidistant

  in external magnetic fields","  If the recent PVLAS results on polarization changes of a linearly polarized
laser beam passing through a magnetic field are interpreted by an axion-like
particle, it is almost certain that it is not a standard QCD axion. Considering
this, we study the general effective interactions of photons with spin-zero
particles without restricting the latter to be a pseudo-scalar or a scalar,
i.e., a parity eigenstate. At the lowest order in effective field theory, there
are two dimension-5 interactions, each of which has previously been treated
separately for a pseudo-scalar or a scalar particle. By following the evolution
in an external magnetic field of the system of spin-zero particles and photons,
we compute the changes in light polarization and the transition probability for
two experimental set-ups: one-way propagation and round-trip propagation. While
the first may be relevant for astrophysical sources of spin-zero particles, the
second applies to laboratory optical experiments like PVLAS. In the one-way
propagation, interesting phenomena can occur for special configurations of
polarization where, for instance, transition occurs but light polarization does
not change. For the round-trip propagation, however, the standard results of

Orionis). The new photometry supports cluster membership for most of them, with
less than 15% of the previous candidates identified as probable non-members.
The near infrared photometry allows us to identify stars with IR excesses, and
we find that the Class II population is very large, around 25% for stars (in
the spectral range M0 - M6.5) and 40% for brown dwarfs, down to 0.04 Msun,
despite the fact that the H(alpha) equivalent width is low for a significant
fraction of them. In addition, there are a number of substellar objects,
classified as Class III, that have optically thin disks. The Class II members
are distributed in an inhomogeneous way, lying preferentially in a filament
running toward the south-east. The IR excesses for the Collinder 69 members
range from pure Class II (flat or nearly flat spectra longward of 1 micron), to
transition disks with no near-IR excess but excesses beginning within the IRAC
wavelength range, to two stars with excess only detected at 24 micron.
Collinder 69 thus appears to be at an age where it provides a natural

The spin-flip phenomenon in supermassive black hole binary mergers,"  Massive merging black holes will be the primary sources of powerful
gravitational waves at low frequency, and will permit to test general

typical range of mass ratios the final stage of the merger is preceded by a
rapid precession and a subsequent spin-flip of the main black hole. This
already occurs in the inspiral phase, therefore can be described analytically
by post-Newtonian techniques. We then identify the radio galaxies with a

Information-Based Asset Pricing,"  A new framework for asset price dynamics is introduced in which the concept
of noisy information about future cash flows is used to derive the price

Each cash flow is modelled by a random variable that can be expressed as a

two terms; one contains true information about the value of the market factor;
the other represents ""noise"". The noise term is modelled by an independent

aggregate of the independent information processes. The price of an asset is
given by the expectation of the discounted cash flows in the risk-neutral
measure, conditional on the information provided by the market filtration. When
the cash flows are the dividend payments associated with equities, an explicit

"Scaling laws of strategic behaviour and size heterogeneity in agent
  dynamics","  The dynamics of many socioeconomic systems is determined by the decision
making process of agents. The decision process depends on agent's

size of some agents poses challenging problems to agents who want to control
their impact, either by forcing the system in a given direction or by hiding

quantify this strategic behavior by detecting scaling relations of allometric
nature between the variables characterizing the trading activity of different

A study of structural properties on profiles HMMs,"  Motivation: Profile hidden Markov Models (pHMMs) are a popular and very
useful tool in the detection of the remote homologue protein families.
Unfortunately, their performance is not always satisfactory when proteins are
in the 'twilight zone'. We present HMMER-STRUCT, a model construction algorithm
and tool that tries to improve pHMM performance by using structural information
while training pHMMs. As a first step, HMMER-STRUCT constructs a set of pHMMs.
Each pHMM is constructed by weighting each residue in an aligned protein
according to a specific structural property of the residue. Properties used
were primary, secondary and tertiary structures, accessibility and packing.
HMMER-STRUCT then prioritizes the results by voting. Results: We used the SCOP
database to perform our experiments. Throughout, we apply leave-one-family-out
cross-validation over protein superfamilies. First, we used the MAMMOTH-mult
structural aligner to align the training set proteins. Then, we performed two
sets of experiments. In a first experiment, we compared structure weighted
models against standard pHMMs and against each other. In a second experiment,
we compared the voting model against individual pHMMs. We compare method
performance through ROC curves and through Precision/Recall curves, and assess
significance through the paired two tailed t-test. Our results show significant
performance improvements of all structurally weighted models over default

Extensive Games with Possibly Unaware Players,"  Standard game theory assumes that the structure of the game is common
knowledge among players. We relax this assumption by considering extensive
games where agents may be unaware of the complete structure of the game. In
particular, they may not be aware of moves that they and other agents can make.
We show how such games can be represented; the key idea is to describe the game
from the point of view of every agent at every node of the game tree. We
provide a generalization of Nash equilibrium and show that every game with
awareness has a generalized Nash equilibrium. Finally, we extend these results
to games with awareness of unawareness, where a player i may be aware that a
player j can make moves that i is not aware of, and to subjective games, where
payers may have no common knowledge regarding the actual game and their beliefs
are incompatible with a common prior.

"Vortex Formation by Merging and Interference of Multiple Trapped
  Bose-Einstein Condensates","  An apparatus for producing atomic-gas Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of
87-Rb atoms is described. The apparatus produces 87-Rb BECs in a dual-chamber

well is partitioned into three sections by an optical barrier, enabling the
simultaneous formation of three independent, uncorrelated BECs. The BECs may
either merge together during their growth, or, for high-energy barriers, the
BECs can be merged together by barrier removal after their formation. Either

"Structural parameters for globular clusters in M31 and generalizations

The Sensitivity of Hybrid Differential Stereoscopy for Spectral Imaging,"  Stereoscopic spectral imaging is an observing technique that affords rapid
acquisition of limited spectral information over an entire image plane
simultaneously. Light from a telescope is dispersed into multiple spectral
orders, which are imaged separately, and two or more of the dispersed images
are combined using an analogy between the (x,y,\lambda) spectral data space and
conventional (x,y,z) three-space. Because no photons are deliberately destroyed
during image acquisition, the technique is much more photon-efficient in some
observing regimes than existing techniques such as scanned-filtergraph or
scanned-slit spectral imaging. Hybrid differential stereoscopy, which uses a
combination of conventional cross-correlation stereoscopy and linear
approximation theory to extract the central wavelength of a spectral line, has
been used to produce solar Stokes-V (line-of-sight) magnetograms in the 617.34
nm Fe I line, and more sophisticated inversion techniques are currently being
used to derive Doppler and line separation data from EUV images of the solar
corona collected in the neighboring lines of He-II and Si-XI at 30.4 nm. In
this paper we develop an analytic a priori treatment of noise in the line shift
signal derived from hybrid differential stereoscopy. We use the analysis to

magnetograph based on stereoscopic spectral imaging, compare those estimates to

Effect of non-linear interface kinetics on coarsening phenomena,"  Coarsening kinetics is usually described using a linear gradient

Our results suggest that non-linear kinetics should be taken into account when designing materials with desired microstructures and properties.",True,1
"Near-IR Spectra of Red Supergiants and Giants. I- Models with Solar and
  with Mixing-Induced Surface Abundance Ratios","  We provide a grid of PHOENIX spectra of red giant and supergiant stars, that
extend through optical and near-IR wavelengths. For the first time, models are
also provided with modified surface abundances of C, N and O, as a step towards
accounting for the changes known to occur due to convective dredge-up (and to
be enhanced in the case of rotation). The aims are (i) to assess how well
current models reproduce observed spectra, (ii) to quantify the effects of the
abundance changes on the spectra, and (iii) to determine how these changes
affect estimates of fundamental stellar parameters.
  Observed giant star spectra can be fitted very well at solar metallicity down
to about 3400K. Modified surface abundances are preferred in only a minority of
cases for luminosity class II, possibly indicating mixing in excess of standard
first dredge-up.
  Supergiant stars show a larger variety of near-IR spectra, and good fits are
currently obtained for about one third of the observations only. Modified
surface abundances help reproducing strong CN bands, but do not suffice to
resolve all the difficulties. The effect of the abundance changes on the
estimated Teff depends on the wavelength range of observation and can amount
several 100K. Reasons for the remaining discrepancies are discussed.

Seeing maximum entropy from the principle of virtual work,"  We propose an extension of the principle of virtual work of mechanics to
random dynamics of mechanical systems. The total virtual work of the
interacting forces and inertial forces on every particle of the system is
calculated by considering the motion of each particle. Then according to the
principle of Lagrange-d'Alembert for dynamical equilibrium, the vanishing
ensemble average of the virtual work gives rise to the thermodynamic
equilibrium state with maximization of thermodynamic entropy. This approach
establishes a close relationship between the maximum entropy approach for
statistical mechanics and a fundamental principle of mechanics, and constitutes
an attempt to give the maximum entropy approach, considered by many as only an
inference principle based on the subjectivity of probability and entropy, the

Vacuum Energy and Renormalization on the Edge,"  The vacuum dependence on boundary conditions in quantum field theories is
analysed from a very general viewpoint. From this perspective the
renormalization prescriptions not only imply the renormalization of the
couplings of the theory in the bulk but also the appearance of a flow in the
space of boundary conditions. For regular boundaries this flow has a large
variety of fixed points and no cyclic orbit. The family of fixed points
includes Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions. In one-dimensional field
theories pseudoperiodic and quasiperiodic boundary conditions are also RG fixed
points. Under these conditions massless bosonic free field theories are
conformally invariant. Among all fixed points only Neumann boundary conditions
are infrared stable fixed points. All other conformal invariant boundary
conditions become unstable under some relevant perturbations. In finite volumes
we analyse the dependence of the vacuum energy along the trajectories of the
renormalization group flow providing an interesting framework for dark energy
evolution. On the contrary, the renormalization group flow on the boundary does
not affect the leading behaviour of the entanglement entropy of the vacuum in
one-dimensional conformally invariant bosonic theories.

"Zero-temperature resistive transition in Josephson-junction arrays at

crossover current determined by the thermal critical exponent. From a dynamic
scaling analysis we determine this critical exponent and the thermally
activated behavior of the linear resistivity. The results are in agreement with
earlier calculations using the resistively shunted-junction model for the

The Epps effect revisited,"  We analyse the dependence of stock return cross-correlations on the sampling
frequency of the data known as the Epps effect: For high resolution data the

true for the empirical data: The Epps curves do not scale with market activity.
The latter result indicates that the time scale of the phenomenon is connected
to the reaction time of market participants (this we denote as human time
scale), independent of market activity. In this paper we give a new description
of the Epps effect through the decomposition of cross-correlations. After
testing our method on a model of generated random walk price changes we justify

QCD in One Dimension at Nonzero Chemical Potential,"  Using an integration formula recently derived by Conrey, Farmer and

chemical potential. In the limit of a large number of colors and fixed number
of lattice points, chiral symmetry is broken spontaneously, and our results are
in agreement with expressions based on a chiral Lagrangian. In this limit, the
eigenvalues of the Dirac operator are correlated according to random matrix
theory for QCD in three dimensions. The discontinuity of the chiral condensate

"SW Sextantis stars: the dominant population of CVs with orbital periods

period of 3.55 h for HS 1813+6122, which allowed us to identify the observed
photometric signal at 3.39 h as a negative superhump wave. The spectroscopic
behaviour clearly identifies these new CVs as new SW Sextantis stars. These new
additions increase the number of known SW Sex stars to 35. Almost 40 per cent

"FUSE Observations of the Dwarf Novae UU Aql, BV Cen, and CH UMa in
  Quiescence","The research paper titled ""FUSE Observations of the Dwarf Novae UU Aql, BV Cen, and CH UMa in Quiescence"" aimed to study the composition and physical properties of the accretion disks in three dwarf novae (UU Aql, BV Cen, and CH UMa) during their quiescent states using Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) observations. The main objective was to determine the properties of the disks and understand the accretion processes that drive dwarf novae.
The study found that the accretion disks in all three dwarf novae have a high ionization state and a low-density region near the disk's midplane, indicating the presence of a hot corona. The researchers also observed the presence of an absorption component in the spectra of the three dwarf novae, which they attributed to the interstellar medium's absorption. They also detected the presence of molecular hydrogen in BV Cen's disk, which was unexpected.
The study's notable conclusion was that the FUSE observations provided valuable insights into the accretion processes in dwarf novae. The high ionization state and the presence of a hot corona suggest that the accretion process is driven by magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. The detection of molecular hydrogen in BV Cen's disk suggests that the disk's material has cooled down, and the accretion process has slowed down.
Overall, the research paper's findings have contributed to our understanding of the accretion processes and physical properties of accretion disks in dwarf novae during quiescence.",True,1
"Experimental and theoretical study of light scattering by individual
  mature red blood cells by use of scanning flow cytometry and discrete dipole

and experimentally analyzed with the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) and
the scanning flow cytometry (SFC), respectively. SFC permits measurement of
angular dependence of light-scattering intensity (indicatrix) of single

light scattering. We have studied the effect of RBC orientation related to the
direction of the incident light upon the indicatrix. Numerical calculations of
indicatrices for several aspect ratios and volumes of RBC have been carried
out. Comparison of the simulated indicatrices and indicatrices measured by SFC
showed good agreement, validating the biconcave disk model for a mature RBC. We
simulated the light-scattering output signals from the SFC with the DDA for
RBCs modeled as a disk-sphere and as an oblate spheroid. The biconcave disk,
the disk-sphere, and the oblate spheroid models have been compared for two
orientations, i.e. face-on and rim-on incidence. Only the oblate spheroid model
for rim-on incidence gives results similar to the rigorous biconcave disk

"Lattice refining loop quantum cosmology, anisotropic models and
  stability","  A general class of loop quantizations for anisotropic models is introduced

in inhomogeneous situations. The main new effect is an underlying lattice which
is being refined during dynamical changes of the volume. In general, this leads
to a new feature of dynamical difference equations which may not have constant
step-size, posing new mathematical problems. It is discussed how such models
can be evaluated and what lattice refinements imply for semiclassical behavior.
Two detailed examples illustrate that stability conditions can put strong
constraints on suitable refinement models, even in the absence of a fundamental
Hamiltonian which defines changes of the underlying lattice. Thus, a large
class of consistency tests of loop quantum gravity becomes available. In this
context, it will also be seen that quantum corrections due to inverse powers of
metric components in a constraint are much larger than they appeared recently
in more special treatments of isotropic, free scalar models where they were

The Plasma Puddle as a Perturbative Black Hole,"  We argue that the weak coupling regime of a large N gauge theory in the Higgs
phase contains black hole-like objects. These so-called ``plasma puddles'' are
meta-stable lumps of hot plasma lying in locally un-Higgsed regions of space.
They decay via O(1/N) thermal radiation and, perhaps surprisingly, absorb all
incident matter. We show that an incident particle of energy E striking the
plasma puddle will shower into an enormous number of decay products whose
multiplicity grows linearly with E, and whose average energy is independent of
E. Once these ultra-soft particles reach the interior they are thermalized by
the plasma within, and so the object appears ``black.'' We determine some gross
properties like the size and temperature of the the plasma puddle in terms of
fundamental parameters in the gauge theory. Interestingly, demanding that the
plasma puddle emit thermal Hawking radiation implies that the object is black
(i.e. absorbs all incident particles), which implies classical stability, which
implies satisfaction of the Bekenstein entropy bound. Because of the AdS/CFT

this paper we perform a first analysis of the stellar content in our SMC fields
through comparison with theoretical isochrones and color functions (CFs). We
find that the underlying spheroidally distributed population is composed of
both intermediate-age and old stars and that its age composition does not show
strong galacto-centric gradients. The three fields situated toward the east, in
the Wing region, show very active current star formation. However, only in the
eastern field closest to the center do we find an enhancement of recent star
formation with respect to a constant SFR(t). The fields corresponding to the
western side of the SMC present a much less populated young MS, and the CF
analysis indicates that the SFR(t) greatly diminished around 2 Gyr ago in these
parts. Field smc0057, the closest to the center of the galaxy and located in
the southern part, shows recent star formation, while the rest of the southern
fields present few bright MS stars. The structure of the red clump in all the
CMDs is consistent with the large amount of intermediate-age stars inferred
from the CMDs and color functions. None of the SMC fields presented here are
dominated by old stellar populations, a fact that is in agreement with the lack

Characterization of open cluster remnants,"  Despite progress in the theoretical knowledge of open cluster remnants and

questions still remain. The methods used to analyze open cluster remnants and
criteria to define them as physical systems are not homogeneous. In this work
we present a systematic method for studying these objects that provides a view
of their properties and allows their characterization. Eighteen remnant
candidates are analyzed by means of photometric and proper motion data. These
data provide information on objects and their fields. We establish criteria for
characterizing open cluster remnants, taking observational uncertainties into
account. 2MASS J and H photometry is employed (i) to study structural
properties of the objects by means of radial stellar density profiles, (ii) to
test for any similarity between objects and fields with a statistical
comparison method applied to the distributions of stars in the CMDs, and (iii)
to obtain ages, reddening values, and distances from the CMD, taking an index
of isochrone fit into account. The UCAC2 proper motions allowed an objective
comparison between objects and large solid angle offset fields. The objective
analysis based on the present methods indicates 13 open-cluster remnants in the
sample. Evidence of the presence of binary stars is found, as expected for
dynamically evolved systems. Finally, we infer possible evolutionary stages
among remnants from the structure, proper motion, and CMD distributions. The
low stellar statistics for individual objects is overcome by means of the
construction of composite proper motion and CMD diagrams. The distributions of
remnants in the composite diagrams resemble the single-star and unresolved
binary star distributions of open clusters.

Statistical properties of giant pulses from the Crab pulsar,"  We have studied the statistics of giant pulses from the Crab pulsar for the
first time with particular reference to their widths. We have analyzed data
collected during 3.5 hours of observations conducted with the Westerbork
Synthesis Radio Telescope operated in a tied-array mode at a frequency of 1200
MHz. The PuMa pulsar backend provided voltage recording of X and Y linear
polarization states in two conjugate 10 MHz bands. We restricted the time
resolution to 4 microseconds to match the scattering on the interstellar
inhomogeneities. In total about 18000 giant pulses (GP) were detected in full

"Colour pairs for constraining the age and metallicity of stellar
  populations","  Using a widely used stellar population synthesis model, we study the ability
of using pairs of AB system colours to break the well-known stellar
age--metallicity degeneracy and give constraints on the two stellar-population
parameters (age and metallicity). The relative age and metallicity
sensitivities of AB system colours that relate to u, B, g, V, r, R, i, I, z, J,
H, and K bands are presented, and the abilities of various colour pairs for
breaking the age--metallicity degeneracy are quantified by an uncertainty

used to constrain the two above stellar-population parameters. This will be
very useful for exploring the stellar populations of distant galaxies. In
detail, colour pairs [(r-K), (u-R)] and [(r-K), (u-r)] are shown to be the best
pairs for estimating stellar ages and metallicities. They can constrain two
stellar-population parameters on average with age uncertainties less than 3.89
Gyr and metallicity uncertainties less than 0.34 dex for typical uncertainties

[(R-K), (u-r)] and [(i-J), (u-R)], can possibly be used for constraining the
two parameters, too. As a whole, our results suggest that colours relating to
both UBVRIJHK and ugriz magnitudes are much better than either UBVRIJHK colours

The association of mm continuum emission with infrared sources from catalogues
(IRAS, MSX, 2MASS), JHK data from the literature and new observations, has been
established according to spatial coincidence, infrared colours and spectral
energy distributions. Only 7 out of 29 resolved mm cores (and 16 out of the 26
unresolved ones) do not exhibit signposts of star formation activity. The other
ones are clearly associated with: far-IR sources, H_2 jets or near-IR objects
showing a high intrinsic colour excess. The distribution of the spectral
indices pertaining to the associated sources is peaked at values typical of
Class I objects, while three objects are signalled as candidates Class 0

located inside the mm-cores. They appear not driven by the most luminous
objects in the field, but rather by less luminous objects in young clusters,
testifying the co-existence of both low- and intermediate-mass star formation.

"On the Entropy Function and the Attractor Mechanism for Spherically

Giant Fluctuations of Coulomb Drag in a Bilayer System,"  We have observed reproducible fluctuations of the Coulomb drag, both as a
function of magnetic field and electron concentration, which are a

Unification and Fermion Mass Structure,"Abstract:
The unification of fundamental forces and the mass structure of fermions are two of the most intriguing and challenging problems in modern particle physics. The Standard Model of particle physics provides a successful description of the known particles and their interactions, but it leaves many questions unanswered, such as the origin of fermion masses and the unification of the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces. Various theoretical frameworks have been proposed to address these issues, including Grand Unified Theories (GUTs), Supersymmetry (SUSY), and Extra Dimensions (EDs). In this paper, we review the current status of these theoretical models and their predictions for the unification of forces and the mass structure of fermions. We also discuss the experimental tests of these models, including the searches for proton decay, supersymmetric particles, and extra dimensions at high-energy colliders. Finally, we explore the implications of the recent experimental results from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the prospects for future discoveries in the quest for unification and fermion mass structure.",True,1
Two-way coupling of FENE dumbbells with a turbulent shear flow,"  We present numerical studies for finitely extensible nonlinear elastic (FENE)
dumbbells which are dispersed in a turbulent plane shear flow at moderate
Reynolds number. The polymer ensemble is described on the mesoscopic level by a
set of stochastic ordinary differential equations with Brownian noise. The
dynamics of the Newtonian solvent is determined by the Navier-Stokes equations.
Momentum transfer of the dumbbells with the solvent is implemented by an
additional volume forcing term in the Navier-Stokes equations, such that both
components of the resulting viscoelastic fluid are connected by a two-way
coupling. The dynamics of the dumbbells is given then by Newton's second law of
motion including small inertia effects. We investigate the dynamics of the flow
for different degrees of dumbbell elasticity and inertia, as given by
Weissenberg and Stokes numbers, respectively. For the parameters accessible in
our study, the magnitude of the feedback of the polymers on the macroscopic
properties of turbulence remains small as quantified by the global energy
budget and the Reynolds stresses. A reduction of the turbulent drag by up to
20% is observed for the larger particle inertia. The angular statistics of the
dumbbells shows an increasing alignment with the mean flow direction for both,
increasing elasticity and inertia. This goes in line with a growing asymmetry
of the probability density function of the transverse derivative of the
streamwise turbulent velocity component. We find that dumbbells get stretched
referentially in regions where vortex stretching or bi-axial strain dominate
the local dynamics and topology of the velocity gradient tensor.

Evidence for a merger of binary white dwarfs: the case of GD 362,"  GD 362 is a massive white dwarf with a spectrum suggesting a H-rich
atmosphere which also shows very high abundances of Ca, Mg, Fe and other

that very extreme assumptions have to be made to account for the observed
abundances of metals. The most favored hypothesis is that the metals are
accreted from either a dusty disk or from an asteroid belt. Here we propose
that the envelope of GD 362 is dominated by He, which at these effective
temperatures is almost completely invisible in the spectrum. This assumption
strongly alleviates the problem, since the diffusion timescales are much larger

exposing the dependency structure of measurements and expressiveness theorems.
  Furthermore we formalize several other measurement-based models:
Teleportation, Phase and Pauli models and present compositional embeddings of
them into and from the one-way model. This allows us to transfer all the theory

Phase Transitions in the Coloring of Random Graphs,"  We consider the problem of coloring the vertices of a large sparse random
graph with a given number of colors so that no adjacent vertices have the same
color. Using the cavity method, we present a detailed and systematic analytical
study of the space of proper colorings (solutions).
  We show that for a fixed number of colors and as the average vertex degree
(number of constraints) increases, the set of solutions undergoes several phase
transitions similar to those observed in the mean field theory of glasses.
First, at the clustering transition, the entropically dominant part of the
phase space decomposes into an exponential number of pure states so that beyond
this transition a uniform sampling of solutions becomes hard. Afterward, the
space of solutions condenses over a finite number of the largest states and
consequently the total entropy of solutions becomes smaller than the annealed
one. Another transition takes place when in all the entropically dominant
states a finite fraction of nodes freezes so that each of these nodes is
allowed a single color in all the solutions inside the state. Eventually, above
the coloring threshold, no more solutions are available. We compute all the
critical connectivities for Erdos-Renyi and regular random graphs and determine
their asymptotic values for large number of colors.
  Finally, we discuss the algorithmic consequences of our findings. We argue
that the onset of computational hardness is not associated with the clustering
transition and we suggest instead that the freezing transition might be the
relevant phenomenon. We also discuss the performance of a simple local Walk-COL
algorithm and of the belief propagation algorithm in the light of our results.

Parametric Learning and Monte Carlo Optimization,"  This paper uncovers and explores the close relationship between Monte Carlo
Optimization of a parametrized integral (MCO), Parametric machine-Learning
(PL), and `blackbox' or `oracle'-based optimization (BO). We make four
contributions. First, we prove that MCO is mathematically identical to a broad
class of PL problems. This identity potentially provides a new application
domain for all broadly applicable PL techniques: MCO. Second, we introduce
immediate sampling, a new version of the Probability Collectives (PC) algorithm
for blackbox optimization. Immediate sampling transforms the original BO
problem into an MCO problem. Accordingly, by combining these first two
contributions, we can apply all PL techniques to BO. In our third contribution
we validate this way of improving BO by demonstrating that cross-validation and
bagging improve immediate sampling. Finally, conventional MC and MCO procedures
ignore the relationship between the sample point locations and the associated
values of the integrand; only the values of the integrand at those locations
are considered. We demonstrate that one can exploit the sample location
information using PL techniques, for example by forming a fit of the sample
locations to the associated values of the integrand. This provides an
additional way to apply PL techniques to improve MCO.

"On the Structure and Properties of Differentially Rotating Main-Sequence
  Stars in the 1-2 M_sun Range","  We conduct a systematic examination of the properties of models for
chemically homogeneous, differentially rotating, main-sequence stars of mass
1-2 M_sun. The models were constructed using a code based on a reformulation of
the self-consistent field method of computing the equilibrium stellar structure
for a specified conservative internal rotation law. [abridged] Relative to
nonrotating stars of the same mass, these models all have reduced luminosities
and effective temperatures, and flattened photospheric shapes (i.e., decreased
polar radii) with equatorial radii that can be larger or smaller, depending on
the degree of differential rotation. For a fixed ratio of the axial rotation
rate to the surface equatorial rotation rate, increasingly rapid rotation
generally deepens convective envelopes, shrinks convective cores, and can lead
to the presence of a convective core (envelope) in a 1 M_sun (2 M_sun) model, a
feature that is absent in a nonrotating star of the same mass. The positions of
differentially rotating models for a given mass M in the H-R diagram can be
shifted in such a way as to approximate the nonrotating ZAMS over ranges in
luminosity and effective temperature that correspond to a mass interval between
M and about 0.7 M. We briefly note a few of the implications of these results,
including (i) possible ambiguities arising from similarities between the
properties of rotating and nonrotating models of different masses, (ii) a
reduced radiative luminosity for a young, rapidly rotating Sun, (iii) the

Isospin diffusion in thermal AdS/CFT with flavor,"  We study the gauge/gravity dual of a finite temperature field theory at
finite isospin chemical potential by considering a probe of two coincident
D7-branes embedded in the AdS-Schwarzschild black hole background. The isospin
chemical potential is obtained by giving a vev to the time component of the
non-Abelian gauge field on the brane. The fluctuations of the non-Abelian gauge
field on the brane are dual to the SU(2) flavor current in the field theory.
For the embedding corresponding to vanishing quark mass, we calculate all Green
functions corresponding to the components of the flavor current correlator. We
discuss the physical properties of these Green functions, which go beyond
linear response theory. In particular, we show that the isospin chemical
potential leads to a frequency-dependent isospin diffusion coefficient.

Projective Hilbert space structures at exceptional points,"  A non-Hermitian complex symmetric 2x2 matrix toy model is used to study
projective Hilbert space structures in the vicinity of exceptional points

projectively extending the original Hilbert space. The complementary

enlarged projective Hilbert space. Geometric phase and phase jump behavior are
analyzed and the usefulness of the phase rigidity as measure for the distance

Excitation of the dissipationless Higgs mode in a fermionic condensate,"  The amplitude mode of a fermionic superfluid, analogous to the Higgs Boson,
becomes undamped in the strong coupling regime when its frequency is pushed

to use the Feshbach resonance regime for parametric excitation of this mode.
The results presented for the BCS pairing dynamics indicate that even weak
dispersion suppresses dephasing and gives rise to persistent oscillations. The
frequency of oscillations extracted from our simulation of the BCS dynamics
agrees with the prediction of the many-body theory.

Photometry of the SW Sex-type nova-like BH Lyncis in high state,"  Aims: We present a photometric study of the deeply eclipsing SW Sex-type
nova-like cataclysmic variable star BH Lyn
  Methods: Time-resolved V-band CCD photometry was obtained for seven nights
between 1999 and 2004.
  Results: We determined 11 new eclipse timings of BH Lyn and derived a refined
orbital ephemeris with an orbital period of 0.155875577(14) day. During the

variations, most probably caused by strong flickering. Time-dependent accretion
disc self-occultation or variations of the hot spot(s) intensity are also

Antenna Combining for the MIMO Downlink Channel,"  A multiple antenna downlink channel where limited channel feedback is
available to the transmitter is considered. In a vector downlink channel
(single antenna at each receiver), the transmit antenna array can be used to
transmit separate data streams to multiple receivers only if the transmitter
has very accurate channel knowledge, i.e., if there is high-rate channel
feedback from each receiver. In this work it is shown that channel feedback
requirements can be significantly reduced if each receiver has a small number
of antennas and appropriately combines its antenna outputs. A combining method
that minimizes channel quantization error at each receiver, and thereby
minimizes multi-user interference, is proposed and analyzed. This technique is
shown to outperform traditional techniques such as maximum-ratio combining

Supersymmetry versus Gauge Symmetry on the Heterotic Landscape,"  One of the goals of the landscape program in string theory is to extract
information about the space of string vacua in the form of statistical
correlations between phenomenological features that are otherwise uncorrelated
in field theory. Such correlations would thus represent predictions of string
theory that hold independently of a vacuum-selection principle. In this paper,
we study statistical correlations between two features which are likely to be
central to any potential description of nature at high energy scales: gauge
symmetries and spacetime supersymmetry. We analyze correlations between these
two kinds of symmetry within the context of perturbative heterotic string
vacua, and find a number of striking features. We find, for example, that the
degree of spacetime supersymmetry is strongly correlated with the probabilities
of realizing certain gauge groups, with unbroken supersymmetry at the string
scale tending to favor gauge-group factors with larger rank. We also find that
nearly half of the heterotic landscape is non-supersymmetric and yet
tachyon-free at tree level; indeed, less than a quarter of the tree-level
heterotic landscape exhibits any supersymmetry at all at the string scale.

Identifying Dark Matter Burners in the Galactic center,"  If the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of our Galaxy grew
adiabatically, then a dense ""spike"" of dark matter is expected to have formed
around it. Assuming that dark matter is composed primarily of weakly
interacting massive particles (WIMPs), a star orbiting close enough to the SMBH
can capture WIMPs at an extremely high rate. The stellar luminosity due to
annihilation of captured WIMPs in the stellar core may be comparable to or even
exceed the luminosity of the star due to thermonuclear burning. The model thus
predicts the existence of unusual stars, i.e. ""WIMP burners"", in the vicinity
of an adiabatically grown SMBH. We find that the most efficient WIMP burners
are stars with degenerate electron cores, e.g. white dwarfs (WD) or degenerate
cores with envelopes. If found, such stars would provide evidence for the
existence of particle dark matter and could possibly be used to establish its
density profile. In our previous paper we computed the luminosity from WIMP
burning for a range of dark matter spike density profiles, degenerate core
masses, and distances from the SMBH. Here we compare our results with the
observed stars closest to the Galactic center and find that they could be
consistent with WIMP burners in the form of degenerate cores with envelopes. We
also cross-check the WIMP burner hypothesis with the EGRET observed flux of
gamma-rays from the Galactic center, which imposes a constraint on the dark
matter spike density profile and annihilation cross-section. We find that the
EGRET data is consistent with the WIMP burner hypothesis. New high precision
measurements by GLAST will confirm or set stringent limits on a dark matter
spike at the Galactic center, which will in turn support or set stringent

"Lowest Landau Level of Relativistic Field Theories in a Strong

We show that in the lowest Landau level approximation, some of the coordinates

non-commutative gauge theories such as the issue with SU(N) gauge symmetries.
Our construction is applied to a minimal extension of the standard model. It is
shown that the Higgs sector might be non-commutative whereas the remaining
sectors of the standard model remain commutative. Signatures of this model at

Fast recursive filters for simulating nonlinear dynamic systems,"  A fast and accurate computational scheme for simulating nonlinear dynamic
systems is presented. The scheme assumes that the system can be represented by
a combination of components of only two different types: first-order low-pass
filters and static nonlinearities. The parameters of these filters and
nonlinearities may depend on system variables, and the topology of the system
may be complex, including feedback. Several examples taken from neuroscience
are given: phototransduction, photopigment bleaching, and spike generation
according to the Hodgkin-Huxley equations. The scheme uses two slightly
different forms of autoregressive filters, with an implicit delay of zero for
feedforward control and an implicit delay of half a sample distance for
feedback control. On a fairly complex model of the macaque retinal horizontal
cell it computes, for a given level of accuracy, 1-2 orders of magnitude faster
than 4th-order Runge-Kutta. The computational scheme has minimal memory

"Investigation of transit-selected exoplanet candidates from the MACHO
  survey","  Context: Planets outside our solar system transiting their host star, i. e.
those with an orbital inclination near 90 degree, are of special interest to
derive physical properties of extrasolar planets. With the knowledge of the
host star's physical parameters, the planetary radius can be determined.
Combined with spectroscopic observations the mass and therefore the density can
be derived from Doppler-measurements. Depending on the brightness of the host
star, additional information, e. g. about the spin-orbit alignment between the
host star and planetary orbit, can be obtained.
  Aims: The last few years have witnessed a growing success of transit surveys.
Among other surveys, the MACHO project provided nine potential transiting
planets, several of them with relatively bright parent stars. The photometric
signature of a transit event is, however, insufficient to confirm the planetary
nature of the faint companion. The aim of this paper therefore is a
determination of the spectroscopic parameters of the host stars as well as a
dynamical mass determination through Doppler-measurements.
  Methods: We have obtained follow-up high-resolution spectra for five stars
selected from the MACHO sample, which are consistent with transits of
low-luminosity objects. Radial velocities have been determined by means of
cross-correlation with model spectra. The MACHO light curves have been compared
to simulations based on the physical parameters of the system derived from the
radial velocities and spectral analyses.
  Aims: We show that all transit light curves of the exoplanet candidates

The other candidates were likely caused by other astrophysical phenomena, such as binary stars or background eclipsing sources.

The results also suggest that microlensing surveys may not be as effective at detecting exoplanets through the transit method compared to other techniques such as radial velocity measurements.",True,1

"Why do some intermediate polars show soft X-ray emission? A survey of

blackbody is not seen in those that have accretion footprints that are always
obscured by accretion curtains or are only visible when foreshortened on the

What Can be Learned Studying the Distribution of the Biggest Fragment ?,"  In the canonical formalism of statistical physics, a signature of a first

"Momentum distributions in time-dependent density functional theory:
  Product phase approximation for non-sequential double ionization in strong
  laser fields","  We investigate the possibility to deduce momentum space properties from
time-dependent density functional calculations. Electron and ion momentum
distributions after double ionization of a model Helium atom in a strong
few-cycle laser pulse are studied. We show that, in this case, the choice of
suitable functionals for the observables is considerably more important than
the choice of the correlation potential in the time-dependent Kohn-Sham

equation, the insufficiency of functionals neglecting electron correlation is
demonstrated. We construct a functional of the Kohn-Sham orbitals, which in

"The blue plume population in dwarf spheroidal galaxies: genuine blue
  stragglers or young stellar population?","  Abridged... Blue stragglers (BSS) are thought to be the product of either
primordial or collisional binary systems. In the context of dwarf spheroidal
galaxies it is hard to firmly disentangle a genuine BSS population from young
main sequence (MS) stars tracing a ~1-2 Gyr old star forming episode. Assuming
that their blue plume populations are made of BSS, we estimate the BSS
frequency for 8 Local Group non star-forming dwarf galaxies, using a
compilation of ground and space based photometry.
  Our results can be summarized as follows: (i) The BSS frequency in dwarf
galaxies, at any given Mv, is always higher than that in globular clusters of
similar luminosities; (ii) the BSS frequency for the lowest luminosity dwarf
galaxies is in excellent agreement with that observed in the Milky Way halo;
and most interestingly (iii) derive a statistically significant
anti-correlation between the BSS frequency and the galaxy Mv.
  The low density, almost collision-less, environments of our dwarf galaxy
sample allow us to infer (i) their very low dynamical evolution; (ii) a
negligible production of collisional BSS; and consequently (iii) that their
blue plumes are mainly made of primordial binaries. The dwarf galaxies
anti-correlation can be used as a discriminator: galaxies obeying the
anti-correlation are more likely to possess genuine primordial BSS rather than
young main sequence stars.

hard-rod fluid confined between two hard lines. In a first stage we study the
semi-infinite system consisting of an isotropic fluid in contact with a single
hard line. We have found complete wetting by the columnar phase at the
wall-isotropic fluid interface. When the fluid is confined between two hard
walls, capillary columnar ordering occurs via a first-order phase transition.
For higher chemical potentials the system exhibits layering transitions even
for very narrow slits (near the one-dimensional limit). The theoretical model
used was a density-functional theory based on the Fundamental-Measure
Functional applied to a fluid of hard rectangles in the restricted-orientation
approximation (Zwanzig model). The results presented here can be checked
experimentally in two-dimensional granular media made of rods, where vertical
motions induced by an external source and excluded volume interactions between
the grains allow the system to explore those stationary states which
entropically maximize packing configurations. We claim that some of the surface
phenomena found here can be present in two-dimensional granular-media fluids.

Generation of Entanglement Outside of the Light Cone,"  The Feynman propagator has nonzero values outside of the forward light cone.
That does not allow messages to be transmitted faster than the speed of light,
but it is shown here that it does allow entanglement and mutual information to
be generated at space-like separated points. These effects can be interpreted
as being due to the propagation of virtual photons outside of the light cone or
as a transfer of pre-existing entanglement from the quantum vacuum. The
differences between these two interpretations are discussed.

Deciphering top flavor violation at the LHC with B factories,"  The LHC will have unprecedented sensitivity to flavor-changing neutral
current (FCNC) top quark decays, whose observation would be a clear sign of
physics beyond the standard model. Although many details of top flavor
violation are model dependent, the standard model gauge symmetries relate top
FCNCs to other processes, which are strongly constrained by existing data. We
study these constraints in a model independent way, using a low energy
effective theory from which the new physics is integrated out. We consider the
most important operators which contribute to top FCNCs and analyze the current
constraints on them. We find that the data rule out top FCNCs at a level
observable at the LHC due to most of the operators comprising left-handed first
or second generation quark fields, while there remains a substantial window for
top decays mediated by operators with right-handed charm or up quarks. If FCNC

Staggered Heavy Baryon Chiral Perturbation Theory,"  Although taste violations significantly affect the results of staggered

develop staggered chiral perturbation theory in the light-quark baryon sector

For 2+1 dynamical quark flavors, the masses of flavor-symmetric nucleons are

chiral perturbation theory. To this order the expansion includes the leading
chiral logarithms, which come from loops with virtual decuplet-like states, as
well as terms the order of the cubed pion mass, which come from loops with
virtual octet-like states. Taste violations enter through the meson propagators

A Diagrammatic Category for the Representation Theory of U_q(sl_n),"  This thesis provides a partial answer to a question posed by Greg Kuperberg
in q-alg/9712003 and again by Justin Roberts as problem 12.18 in ""Problems on
invariants of knots and 3-manifolds"", math.GT/0406190, essentially: ""Can one
describe the category of representations of the quantum group U_q(sl_n)
(thought of as a spherical category) via generators and relations?""
  For each n \geq 0, I define a certain tensor category of trivalent graphs,
modulo isotopy, and construct a functor from this category onto (a full
subcategory of) the category of representations of the quantum group U_q(sl_n).
One would like to describe completely the kernel of this functor, by providing
generators. The resulting quotient of the diagrammatic category would then be a
category equivalent to the representation category of U_q(sl_n).
  I make significant progress towards this, describing certain generators of
the kernel, and some obstructions to further elements. It remains a conjecture
that these relations generate the kernel. My results extend those of
q-alg/9712003, MR1659228, math.QA/0310143 and math.GT/0506403.
  The argument is essentially by constructing a diagrammatic version of the

know this functor is faithful, so a diagram is in the kernel for n exactly if

HST/ACS Coronagraphic Observations of the Dust Surrounding HD 100546,"  We present ACS/HST coronagraphic observations of HD 100546, a B9.5 star, 103
pc away from the sun, taken in the F435W, F606W, and F814W bands. Scattered
light is detected up to 14'' from the star. The observations are consistent
with the presence of an extended flattened nebula with the same inclination as
the inner disk. The well-known ``spiral arms'' are clearly observed and they
trail the rotating disk material. Weaker arms never before reported are also
seen. The inter-arm space becomes brighter, but the structures become more
neutral in color at longer wavelengths, which is not consistent with models
that assume that they are due to the effects of a warped disk. Along the major
disk axis, the colors of the scattered-light relative to the star are \Delta
(F435W-F606W) ~ 0.0--0.2 mags and \Delta (F435W-F814W)~0.5--1 mags. To explain
these colors, we explore the role of asymmetric scattering, reddening, and
large minimum sizes on ISM-like grains. We conclude each of these hypotheses by
itself cannot explain the colors. The disk colors are similar to those derived
for Kuiper Belt objects, suggesting that the same processes responsible for
their colors may be at work here. We argue that we are observing only the
geometrically thick, optically thin envelope of the disk, while the optically
thick disk responsible for the far-IR emission is undetected. The observed
spiral arms are then structures on this envelope. The colors indicate that the

"3d Numerical Models of the Chromosphere, Transition Region, and Corona","  A major goal in solar physics has during the last five decades been to find
how energy flux generated in the solar convection zone is transported and

"Gauge Invariant Factorisation and Canonical Quantisation of
  Topologically Massive Gauge Theories in Any Dimension","  Abelian topologically massive gauge theories (TMGT) provide a topological
mechanism to generate mass for a bosonic p-tensor field in any spacetime
dimension. These theories include the 2+1 dimensional Maxwell-Chern-Simons and
3+1 dimensional Cremmer-Scherk actions as particular cases. Within the
Hamiltonian formulation, the embedded topological field theory (TFT) sector
related to the topological mass term is not manifest in the original phase
space. However through an appropriate canonical transformation, a gauge
invariant factorisation of phase space into two orthogonal sectors is feasible.
The first of these sectors includes canonically conjugate gauge invariant
variables with free massive excitations. The second sector, which decouples
from the total Hamiltonian, is equivalent to the phase space description of the
associated non dynamical pure TFT. Within canonical quantisation, a likewise
factorisation of quantum states thus arises for the full spectrum of TMGT in
any dimension. This new factorisation scheme also enables a definition of the
usual projection from TMGT onto topological quantum field theories in a most
natural and transparent way. None of these results rely on any gauge fixing
procedure whatsoever.

"Gauge Invariant Factorisation and Canonical Quantisation of

We then present our approach to gauge invariant factorisation, which involves a decomposition of the gauge fields into transverse and longitudinal components. We show that this factorisation is consistent with the gauge symmetry and leads to a natural separation of physical degrees of freedom. We then apply canonical quantisation to the transverse sector, and obtain a set of commutation relations that determine the quantum dynamics of the theory. We conclude by discussing the implications of our results for the understanding of topologically massive gauge theories, and highlight their potential relevance for further research in the field. Our findings contribute to the ongoing effort to develop a comprehensive framework for the quantisation of gauge theories, and provide a valuable tool for the study of complex physical systems.",True,1

Towards Functional Flows for Hierarchical Models,"This research paper explores the concept of functional flows in hierarchical models. Hierarchical models are used in various fields, such as biology, economics, and engineering, to represent complex systems. However, the traditional approach to hierarchical modeling relies on a top-down approach, where the system is decomposed into smaller modules, and each module is modeled independently. This approach can lead to a loss of information and oversimplification of the system. Functional flows offer a new approach to hierarchical modeling, where the focus is on the interactions and dependencies between the modules rather than their individual behavior. This paper presents a framework for developing functional flows in hierarchical models and shows how it can be applied to a case study in ecology. The results demonstrate that functional flows can lead to a more accurate representation of the system and provide insights into the dynamics of the system that were not apparent with the traditional approach. The paper concludes by discussing the potential benefits and challenges of using functional flows in hierarchical modeling and suggests future research directions.",True,1
Compton Scattering of Fe K alpha Lines in Magnetic Cataclysmic Variables,"  Compton scattering of X-rays in the bulk flow of the accretion column in
magnetic cataclysmic variables (mCVs) can significantly shift photon energies.
We present Monte Carlo simulations based on a nonlinear algorithm demonstrating
the effects of Compton scattering on the H-like, He-like and neutral Fe K alpha
lines produced in the post-shock region of the accretion column. The peak line
emissivities of the photons in the post-shock flow are taken into consideration
and frequency shifts due to Doppler effects are also included. We find that
line profiles are most distorted by Compton scattering effects in strongly
magnetized mCVs with a low white dwarf mass and high mass accretion rate and
which are viewed at an oblique angle with respect to the accretion column. The
resulting line profiles are most sensitive to the inclination angle. We have
also explored the effects of modifying the accretion column width and using a
realistic emissivity profile. We find that these do not have a significant
overall effect on the resulting line profiles. A comparison of our simulated
line spectra with high resolution Chandra/HETGS observations of the mCV GK Per

The Limits of Special Relativity,"  The Special Theory of Relativity and the Theory of the Electron have had an
interesting history together. Originally the electron was studied in a non

to the conclusion that the mass of the electron could be thought of entirely in
electromagnetic terms without introducing inertial considerations. However the
application of Special Relativity lead to several problems, both for an
extended electron and the point electron. These inconsistencies have, contrary
to popular belief not been resolved satisfactorily today, even within the

Critical Current of Type-II Superconductors in a Broken Bose Glass State,"  The tilt modulus of a defective Abrikosov vortex lattice pinned by material
line defects is computed using the boson analogy. It tends to infinity at long
wavelength, which yields a Bose glass state that is robust to the addition of
weak point-pinning centers, and which implies a restoring force per vortex line
for rigid translations about mechanical equilibrium that is independent of
magnetic field. It also indicates that the Bose glass state breaks into pieces
along the direction of the correlated pinning centers if the latter have finite
length. The critical current is predicted to crossover from two dimensional to
three dimensional behavior as a function of sample thickness along the
correlated pinning centers in such case. That crossover notably can occur at a
film thickness that is much larger than that expected from point pins of
comparable strength. The above is compared to the dependence on thickness shown
by the critical current in certain films of high-temperature superconductors

Pseudogap and charge density waves in two dimensions,"  An interaction between electrons and lattice vibrations (phonons) results in
two fundamental quantum phenomena in solids: in three dimensions it can turn a
metal into a superconductor whereas in one dimension it can turn a metal into
an insulator. In two dimensions (2D) both superconductivity and charge-density
waves (CDW) are believed to be anomalous. In superconducting cuprates, critical
transition temperatures are unusually high and the energy gap may stay unclosed
even above these temperatures (pseudogap). In CDW-bearing dichalcogenides the
resistivity below the transition can decrease with temperature even faster than
in the normal phase and a basic prerequisite for the CDW, the favourable
nesting conditions (when some sections of the Fermi surface appear shifted by
the same vector), seems to be absent. Notwithstanding the existence of
alternatives to conventional theories, both phenomena in 2D still remain the
most fascinating puzzles in condensed matter physics. Using the latest
developments in high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) here we show that the normal-state pseudogap also exists in one of the
most studied 2D examples, dichalcogenide 2H-TaSe2, and the formation of CDW is
driven by a conventional nesting instability, which is masked by the pseudogap.
Our findings reconcile and explain a number of unusual, as previously believed,
experimental responses as well as disprove many alternative theoretical
approaches. The magnitude, character and anisotropy of the 2D-CDW pseudogap are

Optimal flexibility for conformational transitions in macromolecules,"  Conformational transitions in macromolecular complexes often involve the

"The effect of the solar corona on the attenuation of small-amplitude
  prominence oscillations. I. Longitudinal magnetic field","  Context. One of the typical features shown by observations of solar
prominence oscillations is that they are damped in time and that the values of
the damping times are usually between one and three times the corresponding
oscillatory period. However, the mechanism responsible for the attenuation is
still not well-known. Aims. Thermal conduction, optically thin or thick
radiation and heating are taken into account in the energy equation, and their
role on the attenuation of prominence oscillations is evaluated. Methods. The
dispersion relation for linear non-adiabatic magnetoacoustic waves is derived
considering an equilibrium made of a prominence plasma slab embedded in an
unbounded corona. The magnetic field is orientated along the direction parallel
to the slab axis and has the same strength in all regions. By solving the
dispersion relation for a fixed wavenumber, a complex oscillatory frequency is
obtained, and the period and the damping time are computed. Results. The effect
of conduction and radiation losses is different for each magnetoacoustic mode
and depends on the wavenumber. In the observed range of wavelengths the
internal slow mode is attenuated by radiation from the prominence plasma, the
fast mode by the combination of prominence radiation and coronal conduction and
the external slow mode by coronal conduction. The consideration of the external
corona is of paramount importance in the case of the fast and external slow
modes, whereas it does not affect the internal slow modes at all. Conclusions.
Non-adiabatic effects are efficient damping mechanisms for magnetoacoustic
modes, and the values of the obtained damping times are compatible with those
observed.

Moreover, boolean circuits have a representation in terms of elements of a
Thompson group, in such a way that circuit size is polynomially equivalent to
word-length. We show that circuits built with gates that are not constrained to
have fixed-length inputs and outputs, are at most quadratically more compact
than circuits built from traditional gates (with fixed-length inputs and
outputs). Finally, we show that the computational asymmetry function is closely
related to certain distortion functions: The computational asymmetry function
is polynomially equivalent to the distortion of the path length in Schreier
graphs of certain Thompson groups, compared to the path length in Cayley graphs
of certain Thompson monoids. We also show that the results of Razborov and

that it is impossible to estimate the unconditional distribution with
reasonable accuracy even asymptotically. In particular, we show that no
estimator for this distribution can be uniformly consistent (not even locally).
This follows as a corollary to (local) minimax lower bounds on the performance
of estimators for the distribution; performance is here measured by the
probability that the estimation error exceeds a given threshold. These lower
bounds are shown to approach 1/2 or even 1 in large samples, depending on the
situation considered. Similar impossibility results are also obtained for the

process in dependence on deposition parameters: deposition rate, deposition
temperature, electron activation energy and activation current. Pentacene (PnC)
layers deposited on top of those PTFE films are used as a tool to demonstrate
the orienting ability of the PTFE layers. The molecular structure of the PTFE
films was investigated by use of infrared spectroscopy. By means of
ellipsometry, values of refractive index between 1.33 and 1.36 have been
obtained for PTFE films in dependence on deposition conditions. Using the cold

"On the Achievable Rate Regions for Interference Channels with Degraded
  Message Sets","  The interference channel with degraded message sets (IC-DMS) refers to a
communication model in which two senders attempt to communicate with their
respective receivers simultaneously through a common medium, and one of the
senders has complete and a priori (non-causal) knowledge about the message
being transmitted by the other. A coding scheme that collectively has
advantages of cooperative coding, collaborative coding, and dirty paper coding,
is developed for such a channel. With resorting to this coding scheme,
achievable rate regions of the IC-DMS in both discrete memoryless and Gaussian
cases are derived, which, in general, include several previously known rate
regions. Numerical examples for the Gaussian case demonstrate that in the
high-interference-gain regime, the derived achievable rate regions offer
considerable improvements over these existing results.

"Mid-Infrared Fine Structure Line Ratios in Active Galactic Nuclei
  Observed with Spitzer IRS: Evidence for Extinction by the Torus","  We present the first systematic investigation of the [NeV] (14um/24um) and
[SIII] (18um/33um) infrared line flux ratios, traditionally used to estimate
the density of the ionized gas, in a sample of 41 Type 1 and Type 2 active
galactic nuclei (AGNs) observed with the Infrared Spectrograph on board
Spitzer. The majority of galaxies with both [NeV] lines detected have observed
[NeV] line flux ratios consistent with or below the theoretical low density
limit, based on calculations using currently available collision strengths and
ignoring absorption and stimulated emission. We find that Type 2 AGNs have
lower line flux ratios than Type 1 AGNs and that all of the galaxies with line
flux ratios below the low density limit are Type 2 AGNs. We argue that
differential infrared extinction to the [NeV] emitting region due to dust in
the obscuring torus is responsible for the ratios below the low density limit
and we suggest that the ratio may be a tracer of the inclination angle of the
torus to our line of sight. Because the temperature of the gas, the amount of
extinction, and the effect of absorption and stimulated emission on the line
ratios are all unknown, we are not able to determine the electron densities
associated with the [NeV] line flux ratios for the objects in our sample. We
also find that the [SIII] emission from the galaxies in our sample is extended
and originates primarily in star forming regions. Since the emission from
low-ionization species is extended, any analysis using line flux ratios from
such species obtained from slits of different sizes is invalid for most nearby
galaxies.

"Continuous interfaces with disorder: Even strong pinning is too weak in

  How does the presence of a quenched disorder term in the Hamiltonian modify
this transition? We show that an arbitarily weak random field term is enough to
beat an arbitrarily strong delta-pinning in 2 dimensions and will cause
delocalization. The proof is based on a rigorous lower bound for the overlap
between local magnetizations and random fields in finite volume. In 2

"Solving The High Energy Evolution Equation Including Running Coupling
  Corrections","  We study the solution of the nonlinear BK evolution equation with the
recently calculated running coupling corrections [hep-ph/0609105,
hep-ph/0609090]. Performing a numerical solution we confirm the earlier result
of [hep-ph/0408216] that the high energy evolution with the running coupling
leads to a universal scaling behavior for the dipole scattering amplitude. The
running coupling corrections calculated recently significantly change the shape
of the scaling function as compared to the fixed coupling case leading to a
considerable increase in the anomalous dimension and to a slow-down of the
evolution with rapidity. The difference between the two recent calculations is
due to an extra contribution to the evolution kernel, referred to as the
subtraction term, which arises when running coupling corrections are included.
These subtraction terms were neglected in both recent calculations. We evaluate
numerically the subtraction terms for both calculations, and demonstrate that
when the subtraction terms are added back to the evolution kernels obtained in
the two works the resulting dipole amplitudes agree with each other! We then
use the complete running coupling kernel including the subtraction term to find

wavelet analysis, we examine the three-year WMAP and the NVSS data for

wavelet constructed from the second derivative of a Gaussian allows one to
define three local morphological measures, namely the signed-intensity,
orientation and elongation of local features. Detections of correlation between
the WMAP and NVSS data are made with each of these morphological measures. The
most significant detection is obtained in the correlation of the
signed-intensity of local features at a significance of 99.9%. By inspecting

instrumental systematics in the WMAP data are ruled out as the source of all
significant detections of correlation. Our results provide new insight on the
ISW effect by probing the morphological nature of the correlation induced
between the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure of the

"Are constant loop widths an artifact of the background and the spatial

diameter of EUV loops, and we analyze the suitability of the procedure followed
in a previous paper (L\'opez Fuentes, Klimchuk & D\'emoulin 2006) for
characterizing their expansion properties. For the analysis we create different
synthetic loops and we place them on real backgrounds from data obtained with
the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (\textit{TRACE}). We apply to these
loops the same procedure followed in our previous works, and we compare the
results with real loop observations. We demonstrate that the procedure allows
us to distinguish constant width loops from loops that expand appreciably with
height, as predicted by simple force-free field models. This holds even for
loops near the resolution limit. The procedure can easily determine when loops
are below resolution limit and therefore not reliably measured. We find that
small-scale variations in the measured loop width are likely due to
imperfections in the background subtraction. The greatest errors occur in
especially narrow loops and in places where the background is especially bright
relative to the loop. We stress, however, that these effects do not impact the
ability to measure large-scale variations. The result that observed loops do
not expand systematically with height is robust.

Behavioral response to strong aversive stimuli: A neurodynamical model,"  In this paper a theoretical model of functioning of a neural circuit during a
behavioral response has been proposed. A neural circuit can be thought of as a
directed multigraph whose each vertex is a neuron and each edge is a synapse.
It has been assumed in this paper that the behavior of such circuits is
manifested through the collective behavior of neurons belonging to that
circuit. Behavioral information of each neuron is contained in the coefficients
of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) over the output spike train. Those
coefficients form a vector in a multidimensional vector space. Behavioral
dynamics of a neuronal network in response to strong aversive stimuli has been

The neurodynamical model of network behavior has been formulated in terms of
existing memory, synaptic plasticity and feelings. The model has an analogy in
classical electrostatics, by which the notion of force and potential energy has
been introduced. Since the model takes input from each neuron in a network and
produces a behavior as the output, it would be extremely difficult or may even
be impossible to implement. But with the help of the model a possible

Long Gamma-Ray Burst Progenitors: Boundary Conditions and Binary Models,"  The observed association of Long Gamma-Ray Bursts (LGRBs) with peculiar Type

The paper presents a detailed analysis of binary systems as potential progenitors of long GRBs. The authors discuss the different types of binary systems, including those involving neutron stars and black holes, and the conditions under which they can produce long GRBs. They also consider the effects of binary interactions, such as mass transfer and mergers, on the properties of the progenitor systems and the resulting GRBs.
One significant finding of the research is that binary systems are likely to be the dominant progenitors of long GRBs. The authors suggest that the most promising candidates are binary systems involving a black hole and a massive star, which can produce the necessary conditions for a long GRB to occur. They also identify several observational signatures that can be used to test this hypothesis, such as the presence of X-ray and radio emission associated with the GRB.
Overall, the paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of long GRB progenitors and offers insights into the potential role of binary systems in producing these powerful explosions.

"Generation of Large Number-Path Entanglement Using Linear Optics and
  Feed-Forward","  We show how an idealised measurement procedure can condense photons from two
modes into one, and how, by feeding forward the results of the measurement, it
is possible to generate efficiently superpositions of components for which only
one mode is populated, commonly called ``N00N states''. For the basic
procedure, sources of number states leak onto a beam splitter, and the output
ports are monitored by photodetectors. We find that detecting a fixed fraction
of the input at one output port suffices to direct the remainder to the same
port with high probability, however large the initial state. When instead
photons are detected at both ports, Schr\""{o}dinger cat states are produced. We
describe a circuit for making the components of such a state orthogonal, and
another for subsequent conversion to a N00N state. Our approach scales
exponentially better than existing proposals. Important applications include
quantum imaging and metrology.

Revisiting the Issues On Netflow Sample and Export Performance,"  The high volume of packets and packet rates of traffic on some router links
makes it exceedingly difficult for routers to examine every packet in order to
keep detailed statistics about the traffic which is traversing the router.
Sampling is commonly applied on routers in order to limit the load incurred by
the collection of information that the router has to undertake when evaluating
flow information for monitoring purposes. The sampling process in nearly all
cases is a deterministic process of choosing 1 in every N packets on a
per-interface basis, and then forming the flow statistics based on the
collected sampled statistics. Even though this sampling may not be significant
for some statistics, such as packet rate, others can be severely distorted.
However, it is important to consider the sampling techniques and their relative
accuracy when applied to different traffic patterns. The main disadvantage of
sampling is the loss of accuracy in the collected trace when compared to the
original traffic stream. To date there has not been a detailed analysis of the
impact of sampling at a router in various traffic profiles and flow criteria.
In this paper, we assess the performance of the sampling process as used in
NetFlow in detail, and we discuss some techniques for the compensation of loss
of monitoring detail.

Jumping Through Loops: On Soft Terms from Large Volume Compactifications,"  We subject the phenomenologically successful large volume scenario of
hep-th/0502058 to a first consistency check in string theory. In particular, we

Quantifying social group evolution,"  The rich set of interactions between individuals in the society results in
complex community structure, capturing highly connected circles of friends,
families, or professional cliques in a social network. Thanks to frequent
changes in the activity and communication patterns of individuals, the
associated social and communication network is subject to constant evolution.
Our knowledge of the mechanisms governing the underlying community dynamics is
limited, but is essential for a deeper understanding of the development and
self-optimisation of the society as a whole. We have developed a new algorithm
based on clique percolation, that allows, for the first time, to investigate
the time dependence of overlapping communities on a large scale and as such, to
uncover basic relationships characterising community evolution. Our focus is on
networks capturing the collaboration between scientists and the calls between
mobile phone users. We find that large groups persist longer if they are
capable of dynamically altering their membership, suggesting that an ability to
change the composition results in better adaptability. The behaviour of small
groups displays the opposite tendency, the condition for stability being that
their composition remains unchanged. We also show that the knowledge of the
time commitment of the members to a given community can be used for estimating
the community's lifetime. These findings offer a new view on the fundamental

The dynamical Casimir effect in braneworlds,"  In braneworld cosmology the expanding Universe is realized as a brane moving
through a warped higher-dimensional spacetime. Like a moving mirror causes the
creation of photons out of vacuum fluctuations, a moving brane leads to
graviton production. We show that, very generically, Kaluza-Klein (KK)

Entangling Independent Photons by Time Measurement,"  A quantum system composed of two or more subsystems can be in an entangled
state, i.e. a state in which the properties of the global system are well
defined but the properties of each subsystem are not. Entanglement is at the
heart of quantum physics, both for its conceptual foundations and for
applications in information processing and quantum communication. Remarkably,
entanglement can be ""swapped"": if one prepares two independent entangled pairs
A1-A2 and B1-B2, a joint measurement on A1 and B1 (called a ""Bell-State
Measurement"", BSM) has the effect of projecting A2 and B2 onto an entangled
state, although these two particles have never interacted or shared any common
past[1,2]. Experiments using twin photons produced by spontaneous parametric
down-conversion (SPDC) have already demonstrated entanglement swapping[3-6],
but here we present its first realization using continuous wave (CW) sources,
as originally proposed[2]. The challenge was to achieve sufficiently sharp
synchronization of the photons in the BSM. Using narrow-band filters, the
coherence time of the photons that undergo the BSM is significantly increased,
exceeding the temporal resolution of the detectors. Hence pulsed sources can be
replaced by CW sources, which do not require any synchronization[6,7], allowing
for the first time the use of completely autonomous sources. Our experiment
exploits recent progress in the time precision of photon detectors, in the
efficiency of photon pair production by SPDC with waveguides in nonlinear
crystals[8], and in the stability of narrow-band filters. This approach is
independent of the form of entanglement; we employed time-bin entangled
photons[9] at telecom wavelengths. Our setup is robust against thermal or

Coherent control of atomic tunneling,"  We study the tunneling of a two-level atom in a double well potential while
the atom is coupled to a single electromagnetic field mode of a cavity. The

Local de Broglie-Bohm Trajectories from Entangled Wavefunctions,"  We present a local interpretation of what is usually considered to be a
nonlocal de Broglie-Bohm trajectory prescription for an entangled singlet state
of massive particles. After reviewing various meanings of the term
``nonlocal'', we show that by using appropriately retarded wavefunctions (i.e.,

making any appeal to detector inefficiencies.
  We analyze a possible experimental configuration appropriate to massive
two-particle singlet wavefunctions and find that as long as the particles are
not ultra-relativistic, a locality loophole exists and Dirac wave(s) can
propagate from Alice or Bob's changing magnetic field, through space, to the
other detector, arriving before the particle and thereby allowing a local
interpretation to the 2-particle de Broglie-Bohm trajectories.
  We also propose a physical effect due to changing magnetic fields in a

loophole in otherwise perfectly efficient detectors, an effect that is only
significant for near-luminal particles that might otherwise close the locality
loophole.

Local de Broglie-Bohm Trajectories from Entangled Wavefunctions,"This research paper investigates the possibility of deriving local de Broglie-Bohm trajectories from entangled wavefunctions.

Collective behavior of stock price movements in an emerging market,"  To investigate the universality of the structure of interactions in different
markets, we analyze the cross-correlation matrix C of stock price fluctuations
in the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India. We find that this emerging
market exhibits strong correlations in the movement of stock prices compared to
developed markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). This is shown to
be due to the dominant influence of a common market mode on the stock prices.
By comparison, interactions between related stocks, e.g., those belonging to
the same business sector, are much weaker. This lack of distinct sector
identity in emerging markets is explicitly shown by reconstructing the network
of mutually interacting stocks. Spectral analysis of C for NSE reveals that,
the few largest eigenvalues deviate from the bulk of the spectrum predicted by
random matrix theory, but they are far fewer in number compared to, e.g., NYSE.
We show this to be due to the relative weakness of intra-sector interactions
between stocks, compared to the market mode, by modeling stock price dynamics
with a two-factor model. Our results suggest that the emergence of an internal
structure comprising multiple groups of strongly coupled components is a
signature of market development.

Tri-layer superlattices: A route to magnetoelectric multiferroics?,"  We explore computationally the formation of tri-layer superlattices as an
alternative approach for combining ferroelectricity with magnetism to form
magnetoelectric multiferroics. We find that the contribution to the
superlattice polarization from tri-layering is small compared to typical
polarizations in conventionalferroelectrics, and the switchable ferroelectric
component is negligible. In contrast, we show that epitaxial strain and
``negative pressure'' can yield large, switchable polarizations that are
compatible with the coexistence of magnetism, even in materials with no active
ferroelectric ions.

Testing outer boundary treatments for the Einstein equations,"  Various methods of treating outer boundaries in numerical relativity are
compared using a simple test problem: a Schwarzschild black hole with an
outgoing gravitational wave perturbation. Numerical solutions computed using
different boundary treatments are compared to a `reference' numerical solution
obtained by placing the outer boundary at a very large radius. For each
boundary treatment, the full solutions including constraint violations and
extracted gravitational waves are compared to those of the reference solution,
thereby assessing the reflections caused by the artificial boundary. These
tests use a first-order generalized harmonic formulation of the Einstein
equations. Constraint-preserving boundary conditions for this system are
reviewed, and an improved boundary condition on the gauge degrees of freedom is
presented. Alternate boundary conditions evaluated here include freezing the
incoming characteristic fields, Sommerfeld boundary conditions, and the

Dynamical Casimir effect for gravitons in bouncing braneworlds,"  We consider a two-brane system in a five-dimensional anti-de Sitter
spacetime. We study particle creation due to the motion of the physical brane
which first approaches the second static brane (contraction) and then recedes
from it(expansion). The spectrum and the energy density of the generated

Spectral analysis of Swift long GRBs with known redshift,"  We study the spectral and energetics properties of 47 long-duration gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs) with known redshift, all of them detected by the Swift satellite.
Due to the narrow energy range (15-150 keV) of the Swift-BAT detector, the
spectral fitting is reliable only for fitting models with 2 or 3 parameters. As
high uncertainty and correlation among the errors is expected, a careful
analysis of the errors is necessary. We fit both the power law (PL, 2
parameters) and cut--off power law (CPL, 3 parameters) models to the
time-integrated spectra of the 47 bursts, and present the corresponding
parameters, their uncertainties, and the correlations among the uncertainties.
The CPL model is reliable only for 29 bursts for which we estimate the nuf_nu
peak energy Epk. For these GRBs, we calculate the energy fluence and the rest-
frame isotropic-equivalent radiated energy, Eiso, as well as the propagated
uncertainties and correlations among them. We explore the distribution of our
homogeneous sample of GRBs on the rest-frame diagram E'pk vs Eiso. We confirm a
significant correlation between these two quantities (the ""Amati"" relation) and
we verify that, within the uncertainty limits, no outliers are present. We also
fit the spectra to a Band model with the high energy power law index frozen to
-2.3, obtaining a rather good agreement with the ""Amati"" relation of non-Swift
GRBs.

Quantum Auctions,"  We present a quantum auction protocol using superpositions to represent bids

entanglement to arrange for correlations among their bids, with the assurance
that this entanglement is not observable by others. The protocol is useful for
information hiding applications, such as partnership bidding with allocative
externality or concerns about revealing bidding preferences. The protocol
applies to a variety of auction types, e.g., first or second price, and to
auctions involving either a single item or arbitrary bundles of items (i.e.,
combinatorial auctions). We analyze the game-theoretical behavior of the

Opportunistic Relay Selection with Limited Feedback,"  It has been shown that a decentralized relay selection protocol based on
opportunistic feedback from the relays yields good throughput performance in
dense wireless networks. This selection strategy supports a hybrid-ARQ
transmission approach where relays forward parity information to the

adding another level of channel feedback to the decentralized relay selection
problem. It is demonstrated that only one additional bit of feedback is

Growing Perfect Decagonal Quasicrystals by Local Rules,"  A local growth algorithm for a decagonal quasicrystal is presented. We show
that a perfect Penrose tiling (PPT) layer can be grown on a decapod tiling
layer by a three dimensional (3D) local rule growth. Once a PPT layer begins to
form on the upper layer, successive 2D PPT layers can be added on top resulting
in a perfect decagonal quasicrystalline structure in bulk with a point defect
only on the bottom surface layer. Our growth rule shows that an ideal
quasicrystal structure can be constructed by a local growth algorithm in 3D,
contrary to the necessity of non-local information for a 2D PPT growth.

"The IDV source J1128+5925, a new candidate for annual modulation?","  Short time-scale radio variations of compact extragalactic radio sources,
known as IntraDay Variability, can be explained in at least some sources by a
source-extrinsic effect, in which the variations are interpreted as
scintillation of radio waves caused by the turbulent ISM of the Milky Way. One
of the most convincing observational arguments in favour of propagation-induced
variability is the so called annual modulation of the characteristic
variability time-scale, which is due to the orbital motion of the Earth. Data
for the recently discovered and highly variable IDV source J1128+5925 are
presented. We study the frequency and time dependence of the IDV in this
compact quasar. We measure the characteristic variability time-scale of the IDV
throughout the year, and analyze whether the observed changes in the
variability time-scale are consistent with annual modulation. We monitored the
flux density variability of J1128+5925 with dense time sampling between 2.7 and
10.45GHz with the 100m Effelsberg radio telescope of the MPIfR and with the 25m
Urumqi radio telescope. From ten observing sessions, we determine the
variability characteristics and time-scales. The observed pronounced changes of
the variability time-scale of J1128+5925 are modelled with an anisotropic
annual modulation model. The observed frequency dependence of the variation is
in good agreement with the prediction from interstellar scintillation. Adopting
a simple model for the annual modulation model and using also the frequency

On the Origin of Asymmetries in Bilateral Supernova Remnants,"  AIMS: We investigate whether the morphology of bilateral supernova remnants
(BSNRs) observed in the radio band is determined mainly either by a non-uniform
interstellar medium (ISM) or by a non-uniform ambient magnetic field.
  METHODS: We perform 3-D MHD simulations of a spherical SNR shock propagating
through a magnetized ISM. Two cases of shock propagation are considered: 1)
through a gradient of ambient density with a uniform ambient magnetic field; 2)
through a homogeneous medium with a gradient of ambient magnetic field
strength. From the simulations, we synthesize the synchrotron radio emission,
making different assumptions about the details of acceleration and injection of
relativistic electrons.
  RESULTS: We find that asymmetric BSNRs are produced if the line-of-sight is
not aligned with the gradient of ambient plasma density or with the gradient of
ambient magnetic field strength. We derive useful parameters to quantify the
degree of asymmetry of the remnants that may provide a powerful diagnostic of
the microphysics of strong shock waves through the comparison between models
and observations.
  CONCLUSIONS: BSNRs with two radio limbs of different brightness can be
explained if a gradient of ambient density or, most likely, of ambient magnetic
field strength is perpendicular to the radio limbs. BSNRs with converging
similar radio arcs can be explained if the gradient runs between the two arcs.

Nonstationary pattern in unsynchronizable complex networks,"  Pattern formation and evolution in unsynchronizable complex networks are
investigated. Due to the asymmetric topology, the synchronous patterns formed
in complex networks are irregular and nonstationary. For coupling strength
immediately out of the synchronizable region, the typical phenomenon is the
on-off intermittency of the system dynamics. The patterns appeared in this
process are signatured by the coexistence of a giant cluster, which comprises
most of the nodes, and a few number of small clusters. The pattern evolution is
characterized by the giant cluster irregularly absorbs or emits the small
clusters. As the coupling strength leaves away from the synchronization
bifurcation point, the giant cluster is gradually dissolved into a number of
small clusters, and the system dynamics is characterized by the integration and
separation of the small clusters. Dynamical mechanisms and statistical
properties of the nonstationary pattern evolution are analyzed and conducted,
and some scalings are newly revealed. Remarkably, it is found that the few
active nodes, which escape from the giant cluster with a high frequency, are
independent of the coupling strength while are sensitive to the bifurcation
types. We hope our findings about nonstationary pattern could give additional

The paper establishes a set of fundamental results that provide a comprehensive understanding of the theory, including the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the Cauchy-Riemann equations, the behavior of holomorphic mappings under composition, and the extension of holomorphic mappings to the boundary. The paper also discusses various applications of the theory, particularly in the study of complex geometry and algebraic geometry. The crucial finding of this research is the unification of several previously disjointed areas of study in the theory of separately holomorphic mappings. The paper concludes by highlighting the significance of this unified approach in advancing the field and providing a framework for future research.",True,1

"Effective band-structure in the insulating phase versus strong dynamical
  correlations in metallic VO2","  Using a general analytical continuation scheme for cluster dynamical mean
field calculations, we analyze real-frequency self-energies, momentum-resolved
spectral functions, and one-particle excitations of the metallic and insulating
phases of VO2. While for the former dynamical correlations and lifetime effects
prevent a description in terms of quasi-particles, the excitations of the
latter allow for an effective band-structure. We construct an
orbital-dependent, but static one-particle potential that reproduces the full
many-body spectrum. Yet, the ground state is well beyond a static one-particle
description. The emerging picture gives a non-trivial answer to the decade-old
question of the nature of the insulator, which we characterize as a ``many-body
Peierls'' state.

"New possible properties of atomic nuclei investigated by non linear
  methods: Fractal and recurrence quantification analysis","  For the first time we apply the methodologies of nonlinear analysis to
investigate atomic matter. We use these methods in the analysis of Atomic
Weights and of Mass Number of atomic nuclei. Using the AutoCorrelation Function
and Mutual Information we establish the presence of nonlinear effects in the
mechanism of increasing mass of atomic nuclei considered as a function of the
atomic number. We find that increasing mass is divergent, possibly chaotic. We
also investigate the possible existence of a Power Law for atomic nuclei and,
using also the technique of the variogram, we conclude that a fractal regime
could superintend to the mechanism of increasing mass for nuclei. Finally,
using the Hurst exponent, evidence is obtained that the mechanism of increasing
mass in atomic nuclei is in the fractional Brownian regime. The most
interesting results are obtained by using Recurrence Quantification Analysis
(RQA). New recurrences, psudoperiodicities, self-resemblance and class of
self-similarities are identified with values of determinism showing oscillating
values indicating the presence of more or less stability during the process of
increasing mass of atomic nuclei. In brief, new regimes of regularities are

Smooth and Starburst Tidal Tails in the GEMS and GOODS Fields,"  GEMS and GOODS fields were examined to z~1.4 for galaxy interactions and
mergers. The basic morphologies are familiar: antennae with long tidal tails,
tidal dwarfs, and merged cores; M51-type galaxies with disk spirals and tidal
arm companions; early-type galaxies with diffuse plumes; equal-mass
grazing-collisions; and thick J-shaped tails beaded with star formation and
double cores. One type is not common locally and is apparently a loose
assemblage of smaller galaxies. Photometric measurements were made of the tails
and clumps, and physical sizes were determined assuming photometric redshifts.
Antennae tails are a factor of ~3 smaller in GEMS and GOODS systems compared to
local antennae; their disks are a factor of ~2 smaller than locally. Collisions
among early type galaxies generally show no fine structure in their tails,
indicating that stellar debris is usually not unstable. One exception has a
5x10**9 Msun smooth red clump that could be a pure stellar condensation. Most
tidal dwarfs are blue and probably form by gravitational instabilities in the
gas. One tidal dwarf looks like it existed previously and was incorporated into
the arm tip by tidal forces. The star-forming regions in tidal arms are 10 to
1000 times more massive than star complexes in local galaxies, although their
separations are about the same. If they all form by gravitational
instabilities, then the gaseous velocity dispersions in interacting galaxies
have to be larger than in local galaxies by a factor of ~5 or more; the gas
column densities have to be larger by the square of this factor.

index with flux. Some of the blazars do not show any statistical evidence for

"Recovering galaxy star formation and metallicity histories from spectra

Jet-disturbed molecular gas near the Seyfert 2 nucleus in M51,"  Previous molecular gas observations at arcsecond-scale resolution of the

no clear evidence of a disk, aligned nearly east-west and perpendicular to the

features located on the eastern and western sides of the nucleus. The western
feature shows an elongated structure along the jet and a good velocity
correspondence with optical emission lines associated with the jet, suggesting
that this feature is a jet-entrained gas. The eastern feature is elongated
nearly east-west ending around the nucleus. A velocity gradient appears in the
same direction with increasingly blueshifted velocities near the nucleus. This

"Sensor Networks with Random Links: Topology Design for Distributed
  Consensus","  In a sensor network, in practice, the communication among sensors is subject
to:(1) errors or failures at random times; (3) costs; and(2) constraints since
sensors and networks operate under scarce resources, such as power, data rate,
or communication. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is usually a main factor in
determining the probability of error (or of communication failure) in a link.
These probabilities are then a proxy for the SNR under which the links operate.
The paper studies the problem of designing the topology, i.e., assigning the
probabilities of reliable communication among sensors (or of link failures) to
maximize the rate of convergence of average consensus, when the link
communication costs are taken into account, and there is an overall
communication budget constraint. To consider this problem, we address a number
of preliminary issues: (1) model the network as a random topology; (2)
establish necessary and sufficient conditions for mean square sense (mss) and
almost sure (a.s.) convergence of average consensus when network links fail;
and, in particular, (3) show that a necessary and sufficient condition for both
mss and a.s. convergence is for the algebraic connectivity of the mean graph
describing the network topology to be strictly positive. With these results, we
formulate topology design, subject to random link failures and to a
communication cost constraint, as a constrained convex optimization problem to
which we apply semidefinite programming techniques. We show by an extensive
numerical study that the optimal design improves significantly the convergence
speed of the consensus algorithm and can achieve the asymptotic performance of
a non-random network at a fraction of the communication cost.

Charges from Attractors,"  We describe how to recover the quantum numbers of extremal black holes from
their near horizon geometries. This is achieved by constructing the
gravitational Noether-Wald charges which can be used for non-extremal black

appropriately dimensionally reduced solutions. Explicit derivations are
provided for 10 dimensional type IIB supergravity and 5 dimensional minimal

One-dimensional Brownian particle systems with rank dependent drifts,"  We study interacting systems of linear Brownian motions whose drift vector at
every time point is determined by the relative ranks of the coordinate

behavior of the spacings between the Brownian motions arranged in increasing
order. For finitely many Brownian motions interacting in this manner, we
characterize drifts for which the family of laws of the vector of spacings is
tight, and show its convergence to a unique stationary joint distribution given
by independent exponential distributions with varying means. We also study one
particular countably infinite system, where only the minimum Brownian particle

Simultaneous Swift and REM monitoring of the blazar PKS0537-441 in 2005,"  The blazar PKS0537-441 has been observed by Swift between the end of 2004 and
November 2005. The BAT monitored it recurrently for a total of 2.7 Ms, and the
XRT and UVOT pointed it on seven occasions for a total of 67 ks, making it one
of the AGNs best monitored by Swift. The automatic optical and infrared
telescope REM has monitored simultaneously the source at all times. In
January-February 2005 PKS0537-441 has been detected at its brightest in optical
and X-rays: more than a factor of 2 brighter in X-rays and about a factor 60
brighter in the optical than observed in December 2004. The July 2005
observation recorded a fainter X-ray state. The simultaneous optical state,
monitored by both Swift UVOT and REM, is high, and in the VRI bands it is
comparable to what was recorded in early January 2005, before the outburst. In
November 2005, the source subsided both in X-rays and optical to a quiescent
state, having decreased by factors of ~4 and ~60 with respect to the
January-February 2005 outburst, respectively. Our monitoring shows an overall
well correlated optical and X-ray decay. On the shorter time scales (days or
hours), there is no obvious correlation between X-ray and optical variations,
but the former tend to be more pronounced, opposite to what is observed on
monthly time scales. The widely different amplitude of the long term
variability in optical and X-rays is very unusual and makes this observation a

Nova Geminorum 1912 and the Origin of the Idea of Gravitational Lensing,"  Einstein's early calculations of gravitational lensing, contained in a

interpretation of Einstein's notes, it is argued that the appearance of Nova
Geminorum 1912 (DN Gem) in March 1912 may, in fact, provide a relevant context
and motivation for Einstein's lensing calculations on the occasion of his first

Upper bounds on entangling rates of bipartite Hamiltonians,"  We discuss upper bounds on the rate at which unitary evolution governed by a

norm of H, and c is a constant close to 1. Under certain restrictions on the
initial state we prove analogous upper bound for the ancilla-assisted
entangling rate with a constant c that does not depend upon dimensions of local
ancillas. The restriction is that the initial state has at most two distinct

Simulation of Ultra High Energy Neutrino Interactions in Ice and Water,"This research paper focuses on the simulation of ultra high energy neutrino interactions in ice and water. The main objective is to study the propagation of neutrinos through these media and to investigate the possible sources of these particles. The simulations were performed using the Monte Carlo technique, which allowed for the study of the energy deposition, the particle production, and the angular distribution of the products of the interaction. The results show that the cross-sections for neutrino interactions increase with energy, and that the energy deposition is concentrated near the interaction point. Additionally, the simulations suggest that the detection of ultra high energy neutrinos could provide information about the sources of cosmic rays and the properties of the universe.

A neural network approach to ordinal regression,"  Ordinal regression is an important type of learning, which has properties of
both classification and regression. Here we describe a simple and effective
approach to adapt a traditional neural network to learn ordinal categories. Our
approach is a generalization of the perceptron method for ordinal regression.

classification method. Compared with the ordinal regression methods using
Gaussian processes and support vector machines, NNRank achieves comparable
performance. Moreover, NNRank has the advantages of traditional neural
networks: learning in both online and batch modes, handling very large training
datasets, and making rapid predictions. These features make NNRank a useful and
complementary tool for large-scale data processing tasks such as information
retrieval, web page ranking, collaborative filtering, and protein ranking in

"Recent Results on Thermal Casimir Force between Dielectrics and Related
  Problems","  We review recent results obtained in the physics of the thermal Casimir force
acting between two dielectrics, dielectric and metal, and between metal and
semiconductor. The detailed derivation for the low-temperature behavior of the
Casimir free energy, pressure and entropy in the configuration of two real
dielectric plates is presented. For dielectrics with finite static dielectric
permittivity it is shown that the Nernst heat theorem is satisfied. Hence, the
Lifshitz theory of the van der Waals and Casimir forces is demonstrated to be
consistent with thermodynamics. The nonzero dc conductivity of dielectric
plates is proved to lead to a violation of the Nernst heat theorem and, thus,
is not related to the phenomenon of dispersion forces. The low-temperature
asymptotics of the Casimir free energy, pressure and entropy are derived also
in the configuration of one metal and one dielectric plate. The results are
shown to be consistent with thermodynamics if the dielectric plate possesses a
finite static dielectric permittivity. If the dc conductivity of a dielectric
plate is taken into account this results in the violation of the Nernst heat
theorem. We discuss both the experimental and theoretical results related to
the Casimir interaction between metal and semiconductor with different charge
carrier density. Discussions in the literature on the possible influence of
spatial dispersion on the thermal Casimir force are analyzed. In conclusion,
the conventional Lifshitz theory taking into account only the frequency
dispersion remains the reliable foundation for the interpretation of all

On the Kolmogorov-Chaitin Complexity for short sequences,"  A drawback of Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity (K) as a function from s to the
shortest program producing s is its noncomputability which limits its range of

approximate it by computable compression methods. However, such compression
methods do not always provide meaningful approximations--for strings shorter,
for example, than typical compiler lengths. In this paper we suggest an
empirical approach to overcome this difficulty and to obtain a stable
definition of the Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity for short sequences.
Additionally, a correlation in terms of distribution frequencies was found

Cool Stars in Hot Places,"  During the last three decades, evidence has mounted that star and planet
formation is not an isolated process, but is influenced by current and previous
generations of stars. Although cool stars form in a range of environments, from
isolated globules to rich embedded clusters, the influences of other stars on

role of environment in the formation of cool stars and planetary systems; with
an emphasis on the ``hot'' environment found in rich clusters. We review here
the basic results, ideas and questions presented at the session. We have

environment of cool star formation, what role do hot star play in cool star
formation, what role does environment play in planet formation, what is the
role of hot star winds and supernovae, and what was the formation environment

"Probing the Structure of Gamma-Ray Burst Jets with Steep Decay Phase of

"The Solar-Interior Equation of State with the Path-Integral Formalism I.
  Domain of Validity","  This is the first paper in a series that deals with solar-physics
applications of the equation-of-state formalism based on the formulation of the
so-called ""Feynman-Kac (FK) representation"". Here, the FK equation of state is
presented and adapted for solar applications. Its domain of validity is
assessed. The practical application to the Sun will be dealt with in Paper II.
Paper III will extend the current FK formalism to a higher order. Use of the FK
equation of state is limited to physical conditions for which more than 90% of
helium is ionized. This incudes the inner region of the Sun out to about .98 of
the solar radius. Despite this limitation, in the parts of the Sun where it is
applicable, the FK equation of state has the power to be more accurate than the
equations of state currently used in solar modeling. The FK approach is
especially suited to study physical effects such as Coulomb screening, bound
states, the onset of recombination of fully ionized species, as well as
diffraction and exchange effects. The localizing power of helioseismology
allows a test of the FK equation of state. Such a test will be beneficial both
for better solar models and for tighter solar constraints of the equation of
state.

Free zero-range processes on networks,"  A free zero-range process (FRZP) is a simple stochastic process describing
the dynamics of a gas of particles hopping between neighboring nodes of a
network. We discuss three different cases of increasing complexity: (a) FZRP on
a rigid geometry where the network is fixed during the process, (b) FZRP on a
random graph chosen from a given ensemble of networks, (c) FZRP on a dynamical
network whose topology continuously changes during the process in a way which
depends on the current distribution of particles. The case (a) provides a very
simple realization of the phenomenon of condensation which manifests as the
appearance of a condensate of particles on the node with maximal degree. The
case (b) is very interesting since the averaging over typical ensembles of
graphs acts as a kind of homogenization of the system which makes all nodes
identical from the point of view of the FZRP. In the case (c), the distribution
of particles and the dynamics of network are coupled to each other. The
strength of this coupling depends on the ratio of two time scales: for changes
of the topology and of the FZRP. We will discuss a specific example of that
type of interaction and show that it leads to an interesting phase diagram.

both a 1.4nm wide and a 1.8nm wide CNR with channel length of 12.5nm can

Clustering Co-occurrence of Maximal Frequent Patterns in Streams,"  One way of getting a better view of data is using frequent patterns. In this
paper frequent patterns are subsets that occur a minimal number of times in a
stream of itemsets. However, the discovery of frequent patterns in streams has
always been problematic. Because streams are potentially endless it is in
principle impossible to say if a pattern is often occurring or not. Furthermore
the number of patterns can be huge and a good overview of the structure of the

the analysis of the structure of the stream.
  A clustering on the co-occurrence of patterns will give the user an improved
view on the structure of the stream. Some patterns might occur so much together
that they should form a combined pattern. In this way the patterns in the
clustering will be the largest frequent patterns: maximal frequent patterns.

analysis of fragments one is interested in the molecules where patterns occur.

making it better available by using the lattice information in our clustering.

needs to be accessed by the user. The user does not have to browse all the
occurrence data in search of patterns occurring in the same molecules. Instead
one can directly see which frequent subgraphs are of interest.

Physically Sound Hamiltonian Formulation of the Dynamical Casimir Effect,"  Recently [J. Haro and E. Elizalde, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 97}, 130401 (2006)],

attractive potential and a shallow long-ranged barrier exhibits a prepeak in
the static structure factor. This peak can be related to an additional
mesoscopic length scale of clusters and/or voids in the system. Simulation
studies of this system have revealed that it vitrifies upon increasing the

  It remains largely unaffected by the large-scale heterogeneities, and sets
the clock for the slow cluster mode. Results from mode-coupling theory without

The star-forming content of the W3 giant molecular cloud,"  We have surveyed a ~0.9-square-degree area of the W3 giant molecular cloud
and star-forming region in the 850-micron continuum, using the SCUBA bolometer
array on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. A complete sample of 316 dense
clumps was detected with a mass range from around 13 to 2500 Msun. Part of the
W3 GMC is subject to an interaction with the HII region and fast stellar winds

sample depends somewhat on assumptions of dust temperature and is not a simple,
single power law but contains significant structure at intermediate masses.
This structure is likely to be due to crowding of sources near or below the

Spectral method for matching exterior and interior elliptic problems,"  A spectral method is described for solving coupled elliptic problems on an
interior and an exterior domain. The method is formulated and tested on the
two-dimensional interior Poisson and exterior Laplace problems, whose solutions
and their normal derivatives are required to be continuous across the
interface. A complete basis of homogeneous solutions for the interior and
exterior regions, corresponding to all possible Dirichlet boundary values at
the interface, are calculated in a preprocessing step. This basis is used to
construct the influence matrix which serves to transform the coupled boundary
conditions into conditions on the interior problem. Chebyshev approximations
are used to represent both the interior solutions and the boundary values. A
standard Chebyshev spectral method is used to calculate the interior solutions.
The exterior harmonic solutions are calculated as the convolution of the
free-space Green's function with a surface density; this surface density is
itself the solution to an integral equation which has an analytic solution when
the boundary values are given as a Chebyshev expansion. Properties of Chebyshev
approximations insure that the basis of exterior harmonic functions represents
the external near-boundary solutions uniformly. The method is tested by
calculating the electrostatic potential resulting from charge distributions in
a rectangle. The resulting influence matrix is well-conditioned and solutions
converge exponentially as the resolution is increased. The generalization of
this approach to three-dimensional problems is discussed, in particular the

Hamiltonian Unification of General Relativity and Standard Model,"This research paper proposes a unification of General Relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics by introducing a Hamiltonian formulation. The main objective was to provide a framework for a consistent and unified theory that describes all fundamental interactions of nature.

Validating module network learning algorithms using simulated data,"  In recent years, several authors have used probabilistic graphical models to
learn expression modules and their regulatory programs from gene expression
data. Here, we demonstrate the use of the synthetic data generator SynTReN for
the purpose of testing and comparing module network learning algorithms. We
introduce a software package for learning module networks, called LeMoNe, which
incorporates a novel strategy for learning regulatory programs. Novelties
include the use of a bottom-up Bayesian hierarchical clustering to construct
the regulatory programs, and the use of a conditional entropy measure to assign
regulators to the regulation program nodes. Using SynTReN data, we test the
performance of LeMoNe in a completely controlled situation and assess the
effect of the methodological changes we made with respect to an existing
software package, namely Genomica. Additionally, we assess the effect of
various parameters, such as the size of the data set and the amount of noise,
on the inference performance. Overall, application of Genomica and LeMoNe to
simulated data sets gave comparable results. However, LeMoNe offers some
advantages, one of them being that the learning process is considerably faster
for larger data sets. Additionally, we show that the location of the regulators
in the LeMoNe regulation programs and their conditional entropy may be used to
prioritize regulators for functional validation, and that the combination of
the bottom-up clustering strategy with the conditional entropy-based assignment
of regulators improves the handling of missing or hidden regulators.

Validating module network learning algorithms using simulated data,"The research paper titled ""Validating module network learning algorithms using simulated data"" evaluates the effectiveness of module network learning algorithms using simulated data.

Analytic models of plausible gravitational lens potentials,"  Gravitational lenses on galaxy scales are plausibly modelled as having
ellipsoidal symmetry and a universal dark matter density profile, with a Sersic

projected mass or lens potential. We also provide analytic formulae for the
lens potentials of Sersic profiles for integer and half-integer index. We then

our isolated haloes the density profile falls off as radius to the minus fifth
or seventh power beyond the tidal radius, functional forms that allow all
orders of lens potential derivatives to be calculated analytically, while
ensuring a non-divergent total mass. We show how the observables predicted by
this profile differ from that of the original infinite-mass NFW profile.
Expressions for the gravitational flexion are highlighted. We show how
decreasing the tidal radius allows stripped haloes to be modelled, providing a

Dynamic Properties of Molecular Motors in Burnt-Bridge Models,"  Dynamic properties of molecular motors that fuel their motion by actively

as velocity and dispersion, at general conditions is presented. It is found
that dispersion is a decreasing function of the concentration of bridges, while
the dependence of dispersion on the burning probability is more complex. Our

An X-ray Imaging Study of the Stellar Population in RCW49,"  We present the results of a high-resolution X-ray imaging study of the
stellar population in the Galactic massive star-forming region RCW49 and its
central OB association Westerlund 2. We obtained a 40 ks X-ray image of a
17'x17' field using the Chandra X-ray Observatory and deep NIR images using the
Infrared Survey Facility in a concentric 8'3x8'3 region. We detected 468 X-ray
sources and identified optical, NIR, and Spitzer Space Telescope MIR
counterparts for 379 of them. The unprecedented spatial resolution and
sensitivity of the X-ray image, enhanced by optical and infrared imaging data,
yielded the following results: (1) The central OB association Westerlund 2 is
resolved for the first time in the X-ray band. X-ray emission is detected from
all spectroscopically-identified early-type stars in this region. (2) Most
(86%) X-ray sources with optical or infrared identifications are cluster
members in comparison with a control field in the Galactic Plane. (3) A loose
constraint (2--5 kpc) for the distance to RCW49 is derived from the mean X-ray
luminosity of T Tauri stars. (4) The cluster X-ray population consists of
low-mass pre--main-sequence and early-type stars as obtained from X-ray and NIR
photometry. About 30 new OB star candidates are identified. (5) We estimate a
cluster radius of 6'--7' based on the X-ray surface number density profiles.
(6) A large fraction (90%) of cluster members are identified individually using
complimentary X-ray and MIR excess emission. (7) The brightest five X-ray

Spin-exchange collisions of submerged shell atoms below 1 Kelvin,"  Angular momentum changing collisions can be suppressed in atoms whose valence
electrons are submerged beneath filled shells of higher principle quantum

Light Curve Calculations of Supernovae from Fallback Gamma-Ray Bursts,"  The currently-favored model for long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) invokes
explosions from the collapse of a massive star down to a black hole: either
directly or through fallback. Those GRBs forming via fallback will produce much
less radioactive nickel, and hence it has been argued (without any real
calculation) that these systems produce dim supernovae. These fallback
black-hole GRBs have been recently been argued as possible progenitors of a
newly discovered set of GRBs lacking any associated supernovae. Here we present
the first ever radiation-hydrodynamics calculations of the light-curves
produced in the hypernova explosion by a delayed-fallback gamma-ray burst. We
find that the bolometric light-curve is dominated by shock-deposited energy,
not the decay of radioactive elements. As such, observations of such bursts
actually probe the density in the progenitor wind more than it does the
production of radioactive nickel.

Field-Theoretic Simulations of Polyelectrolyte Complexation,"  We briefly discuss our recent field-theoretic study of polyelectrolyte
complexation, which occurs in solutions of two oppositely charged
polyelectrolytes. Charged systems require theoretical methods beyond the

"Zero-variance zero-bias quantum Monte Carlo estimators of the
  spherically and system-averaged pair density","  We construct improved quantum Monte Carlo estimators for the spherically- and
system-averaged electron pair density (i.e. the probability density of finding
two electrons separated by a relative distance u), also known as the
spherically-averaged electron position intracule density I(u), using the
general zero-variance zero-bias principle for observables, introduced by
Assaraf and Caffarel. The calculation of I(u) is made vastly more efficient by
replacing the average of the local delta-function operator by the average of a
smooth non-local operator that has several orders of magnitude smaller
variance. These new estimators also reduce the systematic error (or bias) of
the intracule density due to the approximate trial wave function. Used in
combination with the optimization of an increasing number of parameters in
trial Jastrow-Slater wave functions, they allow one to obtain well converged
correlated intracule densities for atoms and molecules. These ideas can be
applied to calculating any pair-correlation function in classical or quantum
Monte Carlo calculations.

"Diversity of Decline-Rate-Corrected Type Ia Supernova Rise Times: One
  Mode or Two?","  B-band light-curve rise times for eight unusually well-observed nearby Type
Ia supernovae (SNe) are fitted by a newly developed template-building
algorithm, using light-curve functions that are smooth, flexible, and free of
potential bias from externally derived templates and other prior assumptions.
  From the available literature, photometric BVRI data collected over many
months, including the earliest points, are reconciled, combined, and fitted to
a unique time of explosion for each SN. On average, after they are corrected
for light-curve decline rate, three SNe rise in 18.81 +- 0.36 days, while five
SNe rise in 16.64 +- 0.21 days. If all eight SNe are sampled from a single
parent population (a hypothesis not favored by statistical tests), the rms
intrinsic scatter of the decline-rate-corrected SN rise time is 0.96 +0.52
-0.25 days -- a first measurement of this dispersion. The corresponding global
mean rise time is 17.44 +- 0.39 days, where the uncertainty is dominated by
intrinsic variance. This value is ~2 days shorter than two published averages
that nominally are twice as precise, though also based on small samples. When
comparing high-z to low-z SN luminosities for determining cosmological
parameters, bias can be introduced by use of a light-curve template with an
unrealistic rise time. If the period over which light curves are sampled
depends on z in a manner typical of current search and measurement strategies,
a two-day discrepancy in template rise time can bias the luminosity comparison
by ~0.03 magnitudes.

Nonholonomic Ricci Flows: Exact Solutions and Gravity,"  In a number of physically important cases, the nonholonomically

gravitational evolution and field equations transform into systems of nonlinear
partial differential equations which can be integrated in general form. The
second approach develops a general scheme when one (two) parameter families of
exact solutions are defined by any source-free solutions of Einstein's
equations with one (two) Killing vector field(s). A successive iteration
procedure results in a class of solutions characterized by an infinite number
of parameters for a non-Abelian group involving arbitrary functions on one

transforms and Ricci flow evolution. In this paper, we apply the method to
construct in explicit form some classes of exact solutions for multi-parameter

Damped Corrections to Inflationary Spectra from a Fluctuating Cutoff,"  We reconsider trans-Planckian corrections to inflationary spectra by taking

superimposed osillations in the CMB temperature anisotropies are generically
damped by the blurring of the UV scale. To determine the observational
ramifications of this damping, we compare it to that which effectively occurs
when computing the angular power spectrum of temperature anisotropies. The

"Ratios of star cluster core and half-mass radii: a cautionary note on

intermediate-mass black holes in the cores of globular clusters. Based on
theoretical arguments and simulation results it has previously been suggested
that a large core radius -- or particularly a large ratio of the core radius to

clusters. This gives a ratio of the core and half-mass (or half-light) radii
that is directly comparable to the Galactic globular cluster sample. As a
result, it is shown that the ratios observed for the bulk of this sample can be
explained without the need for an intermediate-mass black hole. Furthermore, it
is possible that clusters with large core to half-light radius ratios harbour a

Transcritical bifurcations in non-integrable Hamiltonian systems,"  We report on transcritical bifurcations of periodic orbits in non-integrable
two-dimensional Hamiltonian systems. We discuss their existence criteria and
some of their properties using a recent mathematical description of
transcritical bifurcations in families of symplectic maps. We then present
numerical examples of transcritical bifurcations in a class of generalized
H\'enon-Heiles Hamiltonians and illustrate their stabilities and unfoldings
under various perturbations of the Hamiltonians. We demonstrate that for
Hamiltonians containing straight-line librating orbits, the transcritical
bifurcation of these orbits is the typical case which occurs also in the
absence of any discrete symmetries, while their isochronous pitchfork
bifurcation is an exception. We determine the normal forms of both types of
bifurcations and derive the uniform approximation required to include
transcritically bifurcating orbits in the semiclassical trace formula for the
density of states of the quantum Hamiltonian. We compute the coarse-grained
density of states in a specific example both semiclassically and quantum
mechanically and find excellent agreement of the results.

Stallings' Foldings and Subgroups of Amalgams of Finite Groups,"  In the 1980's Stallings showed that every finitely generated subgroup of a
free group is canonically represented by a finite minimal immersion of a
bouquet of circles. In terms of the theory of automata, this is a minimal
finite inverse automaton. This allows for the deep algorithmic theory of finite
automata and finite inverse monoids to be used to answer questions about
finitely generated subgroups of free groups.
  In this paper we attempt to apply the same methods to other classes of
groups. A fundamental new problem is that the Stallings folding algorithm must
be modified to allow for ``sewing'' on relations of non-free groups. We look at
the class of groups that are amalgams of finite groups. It is known that these
groups are locally quasiconvex and thus all finitely generated subgroups are
represented by finite automata. We present an algorithm to compute such a
finite automaton and use it to solve various algorithmic problems.

"Equivalence of LP Relaxation and Max-Product for Weighted Matching in
  General Graphs","  Max-product belief propagation is a local, iterative algorithm to find the
mode/MAP estimate of a probability distribution. While it has been successfully
employed in a wide variety of applications, there are relatively few
theoretical guarantees of convergence and correctness for general loopy graphs
that may have many short cycles. Of these, even fewer provide exact ``necessary
and sufficient'' characterizations.
  In this paper we investigate the problem of using max-product to find the
maximum weight matching in an arbitrary graph with edge weights. This is done
by first constructing a probability distribution whose mode corresponds to the
optimal matching, and then running max-product. Weighted matching can also be
posed as an integer program, for which there is an LP relaxation. This
relaxation is not always tight. In this paper we show that \begin{enumerate}
\item If the LP relaxation is tight, then max-product always converges, and
that too to the correct answer. \item If the LP relaxation is loose, then
max-product does not converge. \end{enumerate} This provides an exact,
data-dependent characterization of max-product performance, and a precise
connection to LP relaxation, which is a well-studied optimization technique.
Also, since LP relaxation is known to be tight for bipartite graphs, our
results generalize other recent results on using max-product to find weighted
matchings in bipartite graphs.

"Symmetries in Differential Geometry: A Computational Approach to
  Prolongations","  The aim of this work is to develop a systematic manner to close
overdetermined systems arising from conformal Killing tensors (CKT). The
research performs this action for 1-tensor and 2-tensors. This research makes
it possible to develop a new general method for any rank of CKT. This method
can also be applied to other types of Killing equations, as well as to
overdetermined systems constrained by some other conditions.
  The major methodological apparatus of the research is a decomposition of the
section bundles where the covariant derivatives of the CKT land via generalized
gradients. This decomposition generates a tree in which each row represents a
higher derivative. After using the conformal Killing equation, just a few
components (branches) survive, which means that most of them can be expressed
in terms of lower order terms. This results in a finite number of independent
jets. Thus, any higher covariant derivative can be written in terms of these
jets.
  The findings of this work are significant methodologically and, more
specifically, in the potential for the discovery of symmetries. First, this
work has uncovered a new method that could be used to close overdetermined
systems arising from conformal Killing tensors (CKT). Second, through an
application of this method, this research finds higher symmetry operators of
first and second degree, which are known by other means, for the Laplace
operator. The findings also reveal the first order symmetry operators for the
Yamabe case. Moreover, the research leads to conjectures about the second order

"Revisiting the Fermi Golden Rule: Quantum Dynamical Phase Transition as

oscillatory dynamics of a quantum two-level system, in analogy with a classical
damped oscillator, can undergo a quantum dynamical phase transition to a
non-oscillatory phase. This is obtained from a self-consistent solution of the
Generalized Landauer Buettiker Equations, a simplified integral form of the

Stability of Polytropes,"  This paper is an investigation of the stability of some ideal stars. It is
in- tended as a study in General Relativity, with emphasis on the coupling to

conditions should be and we are consequently skeptical of the concept of a
fixed boundary. In this paper we investigate the double polytrope,
characterized by a polytropic index n less than 5 in the bulk of the star and a
value larger than 5 in an outer atmosphere that extends to infinity. It has no
fixed boundary but a region of critical density where the polytropic index
changes from a value that is appropriate for the bulk of the star to a value
that provides a crude model for the atmosphere. The existence of a relation
between mass and radius is confirmed, as well as an upper limit on the mass.

Ageing memory and glassiness of a driven vortex system,"  Many systems in nature, glasses, interfaces and fractures being some
examples, cannot equilibrate with their environment, which gives rise to novel

Unlike their equilibrated counterparts, the dynamics of out-of- equilibrium

Here we investigate a system that straddles the boundary between glass and

response to an applied force evolves according to a stretched exponential, with
the exponent reflecting the deviation from equilibrium. After the force is
removed, the system ages with time and its subsequent response time scales
linearly with its age (simple ageing), meaning that older systems are slower
than younger ones. We show that simple ageing can occur naturally in the
presence of sufficient quenched disorder. Moreover, the hierarchical

Towards a New Standard Model for Black Hole Accretion,"  We briefly review recent developments in black hole accretion disk theory,
emphasizing the vital role played by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) stresses in

of angular momentum transport and allows accretion of matter to proceed at an
interesting rate. Furthermore, we argue that when vertical transport is
important, the radial structure of the accretion disk is modified at small
radii and this affects the disk emission spectrum. We present a simple model
demonstrating how energetic, magnetically-driven outflows modify the emergent
disk emission spectrum with respect to that predicted by standard accretion
disk theory. A comparison of the predicted spectra against observations of
quasar spectral energy distributions suggests that mass accretion rates
inferred using the standard disk model may severely underestimate their true

"Continuous time random walk, Mittag-Leffler waiting time and fractional

The CTRW model is a stochastic process that describes the movement of particles in a random environment, while Mittag-Leffler waiting time is a probability distribution that characterizes the time between two successive jumps in the CTRW model. Fractional diffusion is a generalization of classical diffusion that accounts for anomalous transport phenomena, where the mean square displacement of particles grows sublinearly with time. The paper derives analytical expressions for the probability density function and the moments of the CTRW model with Mittag-Leffler waiting time and fractional diffusion, and investigates their asymptotic behavior. The results show that the CTRW model exhibits non-Gaussian and non-Markovian behavior, with long-range correlations and memory effects that are captured by the Mittag-Leffler waiting time and fractional diffusion.

Integrable Systems and Topology of Isospectral Manifolds,"  The well known Liouville-Arnold theorem says that if a level surface of

in these examples the phase space has points where either the Hamiltonian is
singular or the symplectic form is singular or degenerate. In such situations
the Liouville-Arnold theorem does not apply. However, sometimes it is possible
to define the corresponding flow on the whole level surface of integrals and
use this flow to investigate the topology. Tomei (1982) and Fried (1986) used

"A Metric for Gradient RG Flow of the Worldsheet Sigma Model Beyond First
  Order","  Tseytlin has recently proposed that an action functional exists whose

Group (RG) flow of the target space metric in the worldsheet sigma model. The
gradient is defined with respect to a metric on the space of coupling constants
which is explicitly known only to leading order in perturbation theory, but at
that order is positive semi-definite, as follows from Perelman's work on the
Ricci flow. This gives rise to a monotonicity formula for the flow which is
expected to fail only if the beta function perturbation series fails to
converge, which can happen if curvatures or their derivatives grow large. We
test the validity of the monotonicity formula at next-to-leading order in
perturbation theory by explicitly computing the second-order terms in the
metric on the space of coupling constants. At this order, this metric is found
not to be positive semi-definite. In situations where this might spoil
monotonicity, derivatives of curvature become large enough for higher order
perturbative corrections to be significant.

  Matter","  We have recently pointed out that color magnetic field is generated in dense
quark matter, i.e. color ferromagnetic phase of quark matter. Using light cone
quantization, we show that gluons occupying the lowest Landau level under the
color magnetic field effectively form a two dimensional quantum well (layer),
in which infinitely many zero modes of the gluons are present. We discuss that
the zero modes of the gluons form a quantum Hall state by interacting
repulsively with each other, just as electrons do in semiconductors. Such a
ferromagnetic quark matter with the layer structure of the gluons is a possible
origin of extremely strong magnetic field observed in magnetars.

A discrete computer network model with expanding dimensions,"  Complex networks with expanding dimensions are studied, where the networks
may be directed and weighted, and network nodes are varying in discrete time in
the sense that some new nodes may be added and some old nodes may be removed
from time to time. A model of such networks in computer data transmission is
discussed. Each node on the network has fixed dimensionality, while the
dimension of the whole network is defined by the total number of nodes. Based
on the spectacular properties of data transmission on computer networks, some
new concepts of stable and unstable networks differing from the classical
Lyapunov stability are defined. In particular, a special unstable network
model, called devil network, is introduced and discussed. It is further found
that a variety of structures and connection weights affects the network
stability substantially. Several criteria on stability, instability, and devil
network are established for a rather general class of networks, where some
conditions are actually necessary and sufficient. Mathematically, this paper
makes a first attempt to rigorously formulate a fundamental issue of modeling
discrete linear time-varying systems with expanding dimensions and study their

on three objective functions: (i) the pressure angle, which is a suitable
performance index for the transmission because it determines the amount of
force transmitted to the load vs. that transmitted to the machine frame; (ii)
the Hertz pressure used to evaluate the stresses produced on the contact
surface between cam and roller; and (iii) the size of the mechanism,
characterized by the number of cams and their width.

Gauge Mediation with D-term SUSY Breaking,"  We construct a gauge-mediation model with a D-term supersymmetry (SUSY)
breaking. R-symmetry breaking necessary for generating the SUSY standard-model
gaugino masses is given by gaugino condensation of a strongly coupled gauge
theory in the hidden sector. The energy scale of the strong dynamics of the
hidden sector gauge theory should be around the messenger mass scale M, or
otherwise perturbative calculations would be reliable and would lead to
negative soft mass squared for squarks and sleptons. Thus, all the mass scales
are controlled by a virtually single parameter, \sqrt{D}/M. This model covers a
very wide range of gravitino mass, m_{3/2} \simeq 1 eV--100 TeV. Possible

Demixing and orientational ordering in mixtures of rectangular particles,"  Using scaled-particle theory for binary mixtures of two-dimensional hard
particles with rotational freedom, we analyse the stability of nematic phases
and the demixing phase behaviour of a variety of mixtures, focussing on cases
where at least one of the components consists of hard rectangles or hard
squares. A pure fluid of hard rectangles may exhibit, aside from the usual
uniaxial nematic phase, an additional (tetratic) oriented phase, possessing two
directors, which is the analogue of the biaxial or cubatic phases in three-
dimensional fluids. There is computer simulation evidence that the tetratic
phase might be stable with respect to phases with spatial order for rectangles
with low aspect ratios. As hard rectangles are mixed with other particles not
possessing stable tetratic order by themselves, the tetratic phase is
destabilised, via a first- or second-order phase transition, to uniaxial
nematic or isotropic phases; for hard rectangles of low aspect ratio tetratic
order persists in a relatively large range of volume fractions. The order of
these transitions depends on the particle geometry, dimensions and
thermodynamic conditions of the mixture. The second component of the mixture
has been chosen to be hard discs or disco-rectangles, the geometry of which is
different from that of rectangles, leading to packing frustration and demixing
behaviour, or simply rectangles of different aspect ratio. These mixtures may
be good candidates for observing thermodynamically stable tetratic phases in
monolayers of hard particles. Finally, demixing between fluid
(isotropic--tetratic or tetratic--tetratic) phases is seen to occur in mixtures
of hard squares of different sizes when the size ratio is sufficiently large.

grown dramatically and opened the new branch of high field science, delivering
the focused irradiance, electric fields of which drive electrons into the

modulations of the electron density naturally and robustly take the shape of
paraboloidal dense shells, separated by evacuated regions, moving almost at the
speed of light. When we inject another counter-propagating laser pulse, it is
partially reflected from the shells, acting as relativistic flying

Modelling long-term trends in lunar exposure to the Earth's plasmasheet,"  This paper shows how the exposure of the Moon to the Earth's plasmasheet is
subject to decadal variations due to lunar precession. The latter is a key
property of the Moon's apparent orbit around the Earth - the nodes of that
orbit precess around the ecliptic, completing one revolution every 18.6 years.
This precession is responsible for a number of astronomical phenomena, e.g. the
year to year drift of solar and lunar eclipse periods. It also controls the
ecliptic latitude at which the Moon crosses the magnetotail and thus the number
and duration of lunar encounters with the plasmasheet. This paper presents a
detailed model of those encounters and applies it to the period 1960 to 2030.
This shows that the total lunar exposure to the plasmasheet will vary from 10
hours per month at a minimum of the eighteen-year cycle rising to 40 hours per
month at the maximum. These variations could have a profound impact on the
accumulation of charge due plasmasheet electrons impacting the lunar surface.
Thus we should expect the level of lunar surface charging to vary over the
eighteen-year cycle. The literature contains reports that support this: several
observations made during the cycle maximum of 1994-2000 are attributed to
bombardment and charging of the lunar surface by plasmasheet electrons. Thus we
conclude that lunar surface charging will vary markedly over an eighteen-year
cycle driven by lunar precession. It is important to interpret lunar
environment measurements in the context of this cycle and to allow for the
cycle when designing equipment for deployment on the lunar surface. This is
particularly important in respect of developing plans for robotic exploration
on the lunar surface during the next cycle maximum of 2012-19.

Electrostatic Interactions of Asymmetrically Charged Membranes,"  We predict the nature (attractive or repulsive) and range (exponentially

The role of elastic stresses on leaf venation morphogenesis,"  We explore the possible role of elastic mismatch between epidermis and
mesophyll as a driving force for the development of leaf venation. The current
prevalent 'canalization' hypothesis for the formation of veins claims that the
transport of the hormone auxin out of the leaves triggers cell differentiation
to form veins. Although there is evidence that auxin plays a fundamental role
in vein formation, the simple canalization mechanism may not be enough to
explain some features observed in the vascular system of leaves, in particular,
the abundance of vein loops. We present a model based on the existence of
mechanical instabilities that leads very naturally to hierarchical patterns
with a large number of closed loops. When applied to the structure of high
order veins, the numerical results show the same qualitative features as actual
venation patterns and, furthermore, have the same statistical properties. We
argue that the agreement between actual and simulated patterns provides strong
evidence for the role of mechanical effects on venation development.

The role of elastic stresses on leaf venation morphogenesis,"This research paper aims to investigate the role of elastic stresses in the development of leaf venation patterns. Leaf venation plays a crucial role in plant physiology as it facilitates the transport of water, nutrients, and sugars throughout the leaf. However, the mechanisms that regulate the formation of venation patterns are not fully understood. In this study, we hypothesize that elastic stresses, resulting from differential growth rates in different regions of the leaf, play a significant role in the development of venation patterns. We will use computational simulations to model the growth and development of leaves under different elastic stress conditions. We will also examine the venation patterns of actual leaves under different experimental conditions. Our results will provide insights into the mechanisms that regulate leaf venation morphogenesis and could contribute to the development of more efficient plant engineering techniques.",True,1

Game-Theoretic Power Control in Impulse Radio UWB Wireless Networks,"  In this paper, a game-theoretic model for studying power control for wireless
data networks in frequency-selective multipath environments is analyzed. The
uplink of an impulse-radio ultrawideband system is considered. The effects of
self-interference and multiple-access interference on the performance of Rake
receivers are investigated for synchronous systems. Focusing on energy
efficiency, a noncooperative game is proposed in which users in the network are
allowed to choose their transmit powers to maximize their own utilities, and
the Nash equilibrium for the proposed game is derived. It is shown that, due to
the frequency selective multipath, the noncooperative solution is achieved at

Extrasolar planet taxonomy: a new statistical approach,"  In this paper we present the guidelines for an extrasolar planet taxonomy.
The discovery of an increasing number of extrasolar planets showing a vast

Network Structure of Protein Folding Pathways,"  The classical approach to protein folding inspired by statistical mechanics
avoids the high dimensional structure of the conformation space by using
effective coordinates. Here we introduce a network approach to capture the
statistical properties of the structure of conformation spaces. Conformations
are represented as nodes of the network, while links are transitions via
elementary rotations around a chemical bond. Self-avoidance of a polypeptide
chain introduces degree correlations in the conformation network, which in turn
lead to energy landscape correlations. Folding can be interpreted as a biased
random walk on the conformation network. We show that the folding pathways
along energy gradients organize themselves into scale free networks, thus
explaining previous observations made via molecular dynamics simulations. We
also show that these energy landscape correlations are essential for recovering
the observed connectivity exponent, which belongs to a different universality
class than that of random energy models. In addition, we predict that the
exponent and therefore the structure of the folding network fundamentally
changes at high temperatures, as verified by our simulations on the AK peptide.

"Relic abundance of dark matter in universal extra dimension models with
  right-handed neutrinos","  Relic abundance of dark matter is investigated in the framework of universal

right-handed neutrino in the late universe, (2) production of the first KK
right-handed neutrino from the thermal bath in the early universe, and (3) the
decay of higher KK right-handed neutrinos into the first KK right-handed

Uniqueness Domains in the Workspace of Parallel Manipulators,"  This work investigates new kinematic features of parallel manipulators. It is
well known that parallel manipulators admit generally several direct kinematic
solutions for a given set of input joint values. The aim of this paper is to
characterize the uniqueness domains in the workspace of parallel manipulators,
as well as their image in the joint space. The study focuses on the most usual
case of parallel manipulators with only one inverse kinematic solution. The
notion of aspect introduced for serial manipulators in [Borrel 86] is redefined
for such parallel manipulators. Then, it is shown that it is possible to link
several solutions to the forward kinematic problem without meeting a
singularity, thus meaning that the aspects are not uniqueness domains. An
additional set of surfaces, namely the characteristic surfaces, are
characterized which divide the workspace into basic regions and yield new

The Kinematic design of a 3-dof Hybrid Manipulator,"  This paper focuses on the kinematic properties of a new
three-degree-of-freedom hybrid manipulator. This manipulator is obtained by
adding in series to a five-bar planar mechanism (similar to the one studied by
Bajpai and Roth) a third revolute passing through the line of centers of the
two actuated revolute joints of the above linkage. The resulting architecture
is hybrid in that it has both serial and parallel links. Fully-parallel
manipulators are known for the existence of particularly undesirable
singularities (referred to as parallel singularities) where control is lost [4]
and [6]. On the other hand, due to their cantilever type of kinematic
arrangement, fully serial manipulators suffer from a lack of stiffness and from
relatively large positioning errors. The hybrid manipulator studied is
intrinsically stiffer and more accurate. Furthermore, since all actuators are
located on the first axis, the inertial effects are considerably reduced. In
addition, it is shown that the special kinematic structure of our manipulator
has the potential of avoiding parallel singularities by a suitable choice of
the ""working mode"", thus leading to larger workspaces. The influence of the

"A new method to derive star formation histories of galaxies from their
  star cluster distributions","  Star formation happens in a clustered way which is why the star cluster
population of a particular galaxy is closely related to the star formation
history of this galaxy. From the probabilistic nature of a mass function
follows that the mass of the most-massive cluster of a complete population,
M_max, has a distribution with the total mass of the population as a parameter.
The total mass of the population is connected to the star formation rate (SFR)
by the length of a formation epoch.
  Since due to evolutionary effects only massive star clusters are observable
up to high ages it is convenient to use this M_max(SFR) relation for the
reconstruction of a star formation history. The age-distribution of the
most-massive clusters can therefore be used to constrain the star formation
history of a galaxy. The method, including an assessment of the inherent

Tracking User Attention in Collaborative Tagging Communities,"  Collaborative tagging has recently attracted the attention of both industry

"Angles Between Infinite Dimensional Subspaces with Applications to the
  Rayleigh-Ritz and Alternating Projectors Methods","  We define angles from-to and between infinite dimensional subspaces of a
Hilbert space, inspired by the work of E. J. Hannan, 1961/1962 for general
canonical correlations of stochastic processes. The spectral theory of
selfadjoint operators is used to investigate the properties of the angles,
e.g., to establish connections between the angles corresponding to orthogonal
complements. The classical gaps and angles of Dixmier and Friedrichs are
characterized in terms of the angles. We introduce principal invariant
subspaces and prove that they are connected by an isometry that appears in the
polar decomposition of the product of corresponding orthogonal projectors.
Point angles are defined by analogy with the point operator spectrum. We bound
the Hausdorff distance between the sets of the squared cosines of the angles
corresponding to the original subspaces and their perturbations. We show that
the squared cosines of the angles from one subspace to another can be
interpreted as Ritz values in the Rayleigh-Ritz method, where the former
subspace serves as a trial subspace and the orthogonal projector of the latter
subspace serves as an operator in the Rayleigh-Ritz method. The Hausdorff
distance between the Ritz values, corresponding to different trial subspaces,
is shown to be bounded by a constant times the gap between the trial subspaces.
We prove a similar eigenvalue perturbation bound that involves the gap squared.
Finally, we consider the classical alternating projectors method and propose
its ultimate acceleration, using the conjugate gradient approach. The
corresponding convergence rate estimate is obtained in terms of the angles. We
illustrate a possible acceleration for the domain decomposition method with a
small overlap for the 1D diffusion equation.

"Formation of quasi-solitons in transverse confined ferromagnetic film
  media","  The formation of quasi-2D spin-wave waveforms in longitudinally magnetized
stripes of ferrimagnetic film was observed by using time- and space-resolved
Brillouin light scattering technique. In the linear regime it was found that
the confinement decreases the amplitude of dynamic magnetization near the
lateral stripe edges. Thus, the so-called effective dipolar pinning of dynamic
magnetization takes place at the edges.
  In the nonlinear regime a new stable spin wave packet propagating along a
waveguide structure, for which both transversal instability and interaction
with the side walls of the waveguide are important was observed. The

Nonequilibrium entropy limiters in lattice Boltzmann methods,"  We construct a system of nonequilibrium entropy limiters for the lattice

"Astrophysical gyrokinetics: kinetic and fluid turbulent cascades in
  magnetized weakly collisional plasmas","  We present a theoretical framework for plasma turbulence in astrophysical
plasmas (solar wind, interstellar medium, galaxy clusters, accretion disks).
The key assumptions are that the turbulence is anisotropic with respect to the
mean magnetic field and frequencies are low compared to the ion cyclotron
frequency. The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted
into heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC
CASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and
velocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of
the physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically
reduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the ""inertial range"" above the
ion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic
fluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional
and collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,
which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated
with the Alfvenic component. In the ""dissipation range"" between the ion and
electron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave
(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive
phase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the
energy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless
wave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the
phase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the
electron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling
relations are derived for these cascades. Astrophysical and space-physical
applications are discussed in detail.

restrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of the
leading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolated
solitary wave with the same initial amplitude. This non-local effect is due to
nonlinear wave interactions within the undular bore and can lead to an
additional solitary wave amplitude growth, which cannot be predicted in the

Littlewood-Richardson polynomials,"  We introduce a family of rings of symmetric functions depending on an
infinite sequence of parameters. A distinguished basis of such a ring is
comprised by analogues of the Schur functions. The corresponding structure
coefficients are polynomials in the parameters which we call the
Littlewood-Richardson polynomials. We give a combinatorial rule for their
calculation by modifying an earlier result of B. Sagan and the author. The new
rule provides a formula for these polynomials which is manifestly positive in
the sense of W. Graham. We apply this formula for the calculation of the
product of equivariant Schubert classes on Grassmannians which implies a
stability property of the structure coefficients. The first manifestly positive
formula for such an expansion was given by A. Knutson and T. Tao by using
combinatorics of puzzles while the stability property was not apparent from
that formula. We also use the Littlewood-Richardson polynomials to describe the
multiplication rule in the algebra of the Casimir elements for the general
linear Lie algebra in the basis of the quantum immanants constructed by A.

"Lagrangian quantum field theory in momentum picture. IV. Commutation
  relations for free fields","  Possible (algebraic) commutation relations in the Lagrangian quantum theory
of free (scalar, spinor and vector) fields are considered from mathematical
view-point. As sources of these relations are employed the Heisenberg
equations/relations for the dynamical variables and a specific condition for
uniqueness of the operators of the dynamical variables (with respect to some
class of Lagrangians). The paracommutation relations or some their
generalizations are pointed as the most general ones that entail the validity
of all Heisenberg equations. The simultaneous fulfillment of the Heisenberg
equations and the uniqueness requirement turn to be impossible. This problem is
solved via a redefinition of the dynamical variables, similar to the normal
ordering procedure and containing it as a special case. That implies
corresponding changes in the admissible commutation relations. The introduction
of the concept of the vacuum makes narrow the class of the possible commutation
relations; in particular, the mentioned redefinition of the dynamical variables
is reduced to normal ordering. As a last restriction on that class is imposed
the requirement for existing of an effective procedure for calculating vacuum
mean values. The standard bilinear commutation relations are pointed as the
only known ones that satisfy all of the mentioned conditions and do not
contradict to the existing data.

Order of Epitaxial Self-Assembled Quantum Dots: Linear Analysis,"  Epitaxial self-assembled quantum dots (SAQDs) are of interest for
nanostructured optoelectronic and electronic devices such as lasers,
photodetectors and nanoscale logic. Spatial order and size order of SAQDs are
important to the development of usable devices. It is likely that these two
types of order are strongly linked; thus, a study of spatial order will also
have strong implications for size order. Here a study of spatial order is
undertaken using a linear analysis of a commonly used model of SAQD formation
based on surface diffusion. Analytic formulas for film-height correlation
functions are found that characterize quantum dot spatial order and
corresponding correlation lengths that quantify order. Initial atomic-scale
random fluctuations result in relatively small correlation lengths (about two
dots) when the effect of a wetting potential is negligible; however, the
correlation lengths diverge when SAQDs are allowed to form at a near-critical
film height. The present work reinforces previous findings about anisotropy and
SAQD order and presents as explicit and transparent mechanism for ordering with
corresponding analytic equations. In addition, SAQD formation is by its nature
a stochastic process, and various mathematical aspects regarding statistical
analysis of SAQD formation and order are presented.

Dynamical Objects for Cohomologically Expanding Maps,"  The goal of this paper is to construct invariant dynamical objects for a (not
necessarily invertible) smooth self map of a compact manifold. We prove a
result that takes advantage of differences in rates of expansion in the terms
of a sheaf cohomological long exact sequence to create unique lifts of finite
dimensional invariant subspaces of one term of the sequence to invariant
subspaces of the preceding term. This allows us to take invariant cohomological
classes and under the right circumstances construct unique currents of a given
type, including unique measures of a given type, that represent those classes
and are invariant under pullback. A dynamically interesting self map may have a
plethora of invariant measures, so the uniquess of the constructed currents is
important. It means that if local growth is not too big compared to the growth
rate of the cohomological class then the expanding cohomological class gives
sufficient ""marching orders"" to the system to prohibit the formation of any
other such invariant current of the same type (say from some local dynamical
subsystem). Because we use subsheaves of the sheaf of currents we give
conditions under which a subsheaf will have the same cohomology as the sheaf
containing it. Using a smoothing argument this allows us to show that the sheaf
cohomology of the currents under consideration can be canonically identified
with the deRham cohomology groups. Our main theorem can be applied in both the
smooth and holomorphic setting.

Why there is something rather than nothing (out of everything)?,"  The path integral over Euclidean geometries for the recently suggested

cosmological instantons limited to a bounded range of the cosmological
constant. Inflationary cosmologies generated by these instantons at late stages
of expansion undergo acceleration whose low-energy scale can be attained within
the concept of dynamically evolving extra dimensions. Thus, together with the

suggests the mechanism of constraining the landscape of string vacua and,

A Universality in PP-Waves,"  We discuss a universality property of any covariant field theory in
space-time expanded around pp-wave backgrounds. According to this property the
space-time lagrangian density evaluated on a restricted set of field
configurations, called universal sector, turns out to be same around all the
pp-waves, even off-shell, with same transverse space and same profiles for the
background scalars. In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial
fields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell
pp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal
sector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to
the pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results
can also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also
study such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). In
particular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse
space and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition
relating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive
modes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of this
simplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on
the two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, an
iterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFT
equations of motion has been discussed. All our bosonic string theory analyses

generator, called also microwave phonon laser or phaser (see previous works
arXiv:cond-mat/0303188 ; arXiv:cond-mat/0402640 ; arXiv:nlin.CG/0703050)
Phenomena of branching and long-time refractority (absence of the reaction on
the external pulses) for deterministic chaotic and regular processes of SE were
observed in experiments with various levels of electromagnetic pumping. At the
pumping level growth, the clearly depined increasing of the number of
coexisting SE states has been observed both in real physical experiments and in
computer simulations. This confirms the analytical estimations of the branching
density in the phase space. The nature of the refractority of SE pulses is
closely connected with the pointed branching and reflects the crises of strange
attractors, i.e. their collisions with unstable periodic components of the
higher branches of SE states in the nonautonomous microwave phonon laser.

Magnetic Fingerprints of sub-100 nm Fe Nanodots,"  Sub-100 nm nanomagnets not only are technologically important, but also
exhibit complex magnetization reversal behaviors as their dimensions are
comparable to typical magnetic domain wall widths. Here we capture magnetic
""fingerprints"" of 1 billion Fe nanodots as they undergo a single domain to
vortex state transition, using a first-order reversal curve (FORC) method. As
the nanodot size increases from 52 nm to 67 nm, the FORC diagrams reveal
striking differences, despite only subtle changes in their major hysteresis
loops. The 52 nm nanodots exhibit single domain behavior and the coercivity
distribution extracted from the FORC distribution agrees well with a

Thermal entanglement of qubit pairs on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice,"In this research paper, the authors investigate the thermal entanglement properties of qubit pairs on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice, a two-dimensional lattice system with frustrated interactions. They find that the entanglement entropy of the qubit pairs exhibits a non-monotonic behavior as the temperature is increased, with a peak at a critical temperature. This behavior is attributed to the competition between the thermal fluctuations and the underlying lattice geometry. The authors also show that the critical temperature can be tuned by adjusting the strength of the interactions.

"Switching mechanism of photochromic diarylethene derivatives molecular
  junctions","  The electronic transport properties and switching mechanism of single
photochromic diarylethene derivatives sandwiched between two gold surfaces with
closed and open configurations are investigated by a fully self-consistent
nonequilibrium Green's function method combined with density functional theory.
The calculated transmission spectra of two configurations are strikingly
distinctive. The open form lacks any significant transmission peak within a
wide energy window, while the closed structure has two significant transmission
peaks on the both sides of the Fermi level. The electronic transport properties
of the molecular junction with closed structure under a small bias voltage are
mainly determined by the tail of the transmission peak contributed unusually by
the perturbed lowest perturbed unoccupied molecular orbital. The calculated
on-off ratio of currents between the closed and open configurations is about
two orders of magnitude, which reproduces the essential features of the
experimental measured results. Moreover, we find that the switching behavior
within a wide bias voltage window is extremely robust to both substituting F or
S for H or O and varying end anchoring atoms from S to Se and Te.

"Quantum mechanical approach to decoherence and relaxation generated by

single electron transistor (SET) in the framework of exactly solvable model.
The SET plays a role of the fluctuating environment affecting the qubit's

Solving these equation we obtain decoherence and relaxation rates of the qubit,

that in the weak coupling regime the decoherence and relaxation rates are
directly related to the spectral density taken at Rabi or at zero frequency,
depending on what a particular qubit's parameters is fluctuating. This relation
holds also in the presence of weak back-action of the qubit on the fluctuating
environment. In the case of strong back-action, such simple relationship no
longer holds, even if the qubit-SET coupling is small. It does not hold either
in the strong-coupling regime, even in the absence of the back-action. In
addition, we found that our model predicts localization of the qubit in the

"Capacity of a Multiple-Antenna Fading Channel with a Quantized Precoding
  Matrix","  Given a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel, feedback from the
receiver can be used to specify a transmit precoding matrix, which selectively
activates the strongest channel modes. Here we analyze the performance of
Random Vector Quantization (RVQ), in which the precoding matrix is selected
from a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributed
entries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver,
which relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to the
transmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity of
beamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large system
refers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all go
to infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,
i.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. The
performance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalar
quantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a random
subspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, and
approximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers
(matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples show
that these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-size
systems of interest. Given a target spectral efficiency, numerical examples
show that the amount of feedback required by the linear MMSE receiver is only
slightly more than that required by the optimal receiver, whereas the matched
filter can require significantly more feedback.

"Geometric Complexity Theory VI: the flip via saturated and positive
  integer programming in representation theory and algebraic geometry","  This article belongs to a series on geometric complexity theory (GCT), an
approach to the P vs. NP and related problems through algebraic geometry and
representation theory. The basic principle behind this approach is called the
flip. In essence, it reduces the negative hypothesis in complexity theory (the
lower bound problems), such as the P vs. NP problem in characteristic zero, to
the positive hypothesis in complexity theory (the upper bound problems):
specifically, to showing that the problems of deciding nonvanishing of the
fundamental structural constants in representation theory and algebraic
geometry, such as the well known plethysm constants--or rather certain relaxed
forms of these decision probelms--belong to the complexity class P. In this
article, we suggest a plan for implementing the flip, i.e., for showing that
these relaxed decision problems belong to P. This is based on the reduction of
the preceding complexity-theoretic positive hypotheses to mathematical
positivity hypotheses: specifically, to showing that there exist positive
formulae--i.e. formulae with nonnegative coefficients--for the structural
constants under consideration and certain functions associated with them. These
turn out be intimately related to the similar positivity properties of the
Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the multiplicative structural constants of the
canonical (global crystal) bases in the theory of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum
groups. The known proofs of these positivity properties depend on the Riemann
hypothesis over finite fields and the related results. Thus the reduction here,
in conjunction with the flip, in essence, says that the validity of the P vs.
NP conjecture in characteristic zero is intimately linked to the Riemann
hypothesis over finite fields and related problems.

Automated Generation of Layout and Control for Quantum Circuits,"  We present a computer-aided design flow for quantum circuits, complete with

We then propose two polynomial-time design heuristics: a greedy algorithm
suitable for small, congestion-free quantum circuits and a dataflow-based
analysis approach to placement and routing with implicit initial placement of
qubits. Finally, we show that our dataflow-based heuristic generates better

"Modeling the Spectral Energy Distribution and Variability of 3C 66A
  during the WEBT campaign of 2003 -- 2004","  The BL Lac object 3C 66A was observed in an extensive multiwavelength
monitoring campaign from July 2003 till April 2004. The spectral energy
distribution (SED) was measured over the entire electromagnetic spectrum, with
flux measurements from radio to X-ray frequencies and upper limits in the very
high energy (VHE) gamma-ray regime. Here, we use a time-dependent leptonic jet
model to reproduce the SED and optical spectral variability observed during our
multiwavelength campaign. Our model simulations could successfully reproduce
the observed SED and optical light curves and predict an intrinsic cutoff value
for the VHE gamma-ray emission at ~ 4 GeV. The effect of the optical depth due
to the intergalactic infrared background radiation (IIBR) on the peak of the
high-energy component of 3C 66A was found to be negligible. Also, the presence
of a broad line region (BLR) in the case of 3C 66A may play an important role
in the emission of gamma-ray photons when the emission region is very close to
the central engine, but further out, the production mechanism of hard X-ray and
gamma-ray photons becomes rapidly dominated by synchrotron self-Compton
emission. We further discuss the possibility of an observable X-ray spectral
variability pattern. The simulated results do not predict observable hysteresis

The main objective of the study is to model the spectral energy distribution and investigate the mechanisms responsible for the observed variability of the source.
The researchers used multi-frequency observations from radio to gamma-rays to construct the spectral energy distribution and model the emission mechanisms. They found that the observed variability of the source can be explained by a combination of synchrotron and inverse Compton emission from the relativistic jet, where the synchrotron emission dominates at lower frequencies and the inverse Compton emission dominates at higher frequencies.
The study also revealed that the gamma-ray emission of 3C 66A is likely produced by inverse Compton scattering of photons from the broad-line region or the dusty torus. The researchers suggest that the observed variability in the gamma-ray band is due to changes in the level of the external photon fields.
Overall, the study provides a detailed investigation of the spectral energy distribution and variability of 3C 66A, and highlights the importance of multi-frequency observations in understanding the emission mechanisms of blazars.",True,1

Common Envelope Evolution Redux,"  Common envelopes form in dynamical time scale mass exchange, when the
envelope of a donor star engulfs a much denser companion, and the core of the
donor plus the dense companion star spiral inward through this dissipative
envelope. As conceived by Paczynski and Ostriker, this process must be
responsible for the creation of short-period binaries with degenerate
components, and, indeed, it has proven capable of accounting for short-period
binaries containing one white dwarf component. However, attempts to reconstruct
the evolutionary histories of close double white dwarfs have proven more
problematic, and point to the need for enhanced systemic mass loss, either
during the close of the first, slow episode of mass transfer that produced the
first white dwarf, or during the detached phase preceding the final, common
envelope episode. The survival of long-period interacting binaries with massive
white dwarfs, such as the recurrent novae T CrB and RS Oph, also presents
interpretative difficulties for simple energetic treatments of common envelope
evolution. Their existence implies that major terms are missing from usual
formulations of the energy budget for common envelope evolution. The most
plausible missing energy term is the energy released by recombination in the
common envelope, and, indeed, a simple reformulation the energy budget
explicitly including recombination resolves this issue.

The core binary fractions of star clusters from realistic simulations,"  We investigate the evolution of binary fractions in star clusters using
N-body models of up to 100000 stars. Primordial binary frequencies in these
models range from 5% to 50%. Simulations are performed with the NBODY4 code and
include a full mass spectrum of stars, stellar evolution, binary evolution and
the tidal field of the Galaxy. We find that the overall binary fraction of a
cluster almost always remains close to the primordial value, except at late
times when a cluster is near dissolution. A critical exception occurs in the
central regions where we observe a marked increase in binary fraction with time
-- a simulation starting with 100000 stars and 5% binaries reached a core
binary frequency as high as 40% at the end of the core-collapse phase
(occurring at 16 Gyr with ~20000 stars remaining). Binaries are destroyed in
the core by a variety of processes as a cluster evolves, but the combination of
mass-segregation and creation of new binaries in exchange interactions produces
the observed increase in relative number. We also find that binaries are cycled
into and out of cluster cores in a manner that is analogous to convection in
stars. For models of 100000 stars we show that the evolution of the core-radius
up to the end of the initial phase of core-collapse is not affected by the
exact value of the primordial binary frequency (for frequencies of 10% or
less). We discuss the ramifications of our results for the likely primordial

Periodic accretion from a circumbinary disk in the young binary UZ Tau E,"  Close pre-main-sequence binary stars are expected to clear central holes in
their protoplanetary disks, but the extent to which material can flow from the
circumbinary disk across the gap onto the individual circumstellar disks has

outer disk is predicted to induce mass flow across the gap, resulting in
accretion that varies with the binary period. This accretion may manifest
itself observationally as periodic changes in luminosity. Here we present a

brightness of UZ Tau E shows significant random variability, but the overall
periodic pattern is a broad peak in enhanced brightness, spanning more than
half the binary orbital period. The variability of the H-alpha line is not as
clearly periodic, but given the sparseness of the data, some periodic component
is not ruled out. The photometric variations are in good agreement with

Effect of node deleting on network structure,"  The ever-increasing knowledge of the structure of various real-world networks

the network undergoes a transition from scale-free to exponential forms as the
intensity of node deleting increases. At the same time, nontrivial
disassortative degree correlation develops spontaneously as a natural result of
network evolution in the model. We also demonstrate that node deleting
introduced in the model does not destroy the connectedness of a growing network

Complete Shrinking Ricci Solitons have Finite Fundamental Group,"  We show that if a complete Riemannian manifold supports a vector field such
that the Ricci tensor plus the Lie derivative of the metric with respect to the
vector field has a positive lower bound, then the fundamental group is finite.

Probability distributions generated by fractional diffusion equations,"  Fractional calculus allows one to generalize the linear, one-dimensional,

On the pseudospectrum of elliptic quadratic differential operators,"  We study the pseudospectrum of a class of non-selfadjoint differential

When this condition is violated, we prove that it occurs some strong spectral
instabilities for the high energies of these operators, in some regions which

On generalized entropy measures and pathways,"  Product probability property, known in the literature as statistical
independence, is examined first. Then generalized entropies are introduced, all
of which give generalizations to Shannon entropy. It is shown that the nature
of the recursivity postulate automatically determines the logarithmic
functional form for Shannon entropy. Due to the logarithmic nature, Shannon
entropy naturally gives rise to additivity, when applied to situations having
product probability property. It is argued that the natural process is
non-additivity, important, for example, in statistical mechanics, even in
product probability property situations and additivity can hold due to the
involvement of a recursivity postulate leading to a logarithmic function.
Generalizations, including Mathai's generalized entropy are introduced and some
of the properties are examined. Situations are examined where Mathai's entropy

"The effect of a fifth large-scale space-time dimension on the
  conservation of energy in a four dimensional Universe","  The effect of introducing a fifth large-scale space-time dimension to the
equations of orbital dynamics was analysed in an earlier paper by the authors.
The results showed good agreement with the observed flat rotation curves of
galaxies and the Pioneer Anomaly. This analysis did not require the
modification of Newtonian dynamics, but rather only their restatement in a five
dimensional framework. The same analysis derived a acceleration parameter ar,
which plays an important role in the restated equations of orbital dynamics,
and suggested a value for ar. In this companion paper, the principle of
conservation of energy is restated within the same five-dimensional framework.
The resulting analysis provides an alternative route to estimating the value of
ar, without reference to the equations of orbital dynamics, and based solely on
key cosmological constants and parameters, including the gravitational
constant, G. The same analysis suggests that: (i) the inverse square law of
gravity may itself be due to the conservation of energy at the boundary between
a four-dimensional universe and a fifth large-scale space-time dimension; and
(ii) there is a limiting case for the Tulley-Fisher relationship linking the

"Lattice Boltzmann inverse kinetic approach for the incompressible
  Navier-Stokes equations","  In spite of the large number of papers appeared in the past which are devoted
to the lattice Boltzmann (LB) methods, basic aspects of the theory still remain
unchallenged. An unsolved theoretical issue is related to the construction of a
discrete kinetic theory which yields \textit{exactly} the fluid equations,
i.e., is non-asymptotic (here denoted as \textit{LB inverse kinetic theory}).
The purpose of this paper is theoretical and aims at developing an inverse
kinetic approach of this type. In principle infinite solutions exist to this
problem but the freedom can be exploited in order to meet important
requirements. In particular, the discrete kinetic theory can be defined so that
it yields exactly the fluid equation also for arbitrary non-equilibrium (but
suitably smooth) kinetic distribution functions and arbitrarily close to the
boundary of the fluid domain. Unlike previous entropic LB methods the theorem
can be obtained without functional constraints on the class of the initial
distribution functions. Possible realizations of the theory and asymptotic
approximations are provided which permit to determine the fluid equations
\textit{with prescribed accuracy.} As a result, asymptotic accuracy estimates
of customary LB approaches and comparisons with the Chorin artificial
compressibility method are discussed.

Diffuse X-ray Emission from the Carina Nebula Observed with Suzaku,"  A number of giant HII regions are associated with soft diffuse X-ray
emission. Among these, the Carina nebula possesses the brightest soft diffuse

"FIRST-based survey of Compact Steep Spectrum sources, V.
  Milliarcsecond-scale morphology of CSS objects","  Multifrequency VLBA observations of the final group of ten objects in a
sample of FIRST-based compact steep spectrum (CSS) sources are presented. The
sample was selected to investigate whether objects of this kind could be relics

whose asymmetric two-sided morphology on a scale of several hundred parsecs,
extending in two different directions, may suggest intermittent activity. The

"Spin and pseudospin symmetries and the equivalent spectra of

AMR simulations of the low T/|W| bar-mode instability of neutron stars,"  It has been recently argued through numerical work that rotating stars with a
high degree of differential rotation are dynamically unstable against bar-mode
deformation, even for values of the ratio of rotational kinetic energy to
gravitational potential energy as low as O(0.01). This may have implications
for gravitational wave astronomy in high-frequency sources such as core

nonlinear dynamics of the instability are revealed in our simulations, which
show that the excitation of Kelvin-Helmholtz-like fluid modes outside the
corotation radius of the star leads to the saturation of the bar-mode
deformation. While the overall trends reported in an earlier investigation are

Evolutionary games on minimally structured populations,"  Population structure induced by both spatial embedding and more general
networks of interaction, such as model social networks, have been shown to have
a fundamental effect on the dynamics and outcome of evolutionary games. These
effects have, however, proved to be sensitive to the details of the underlying
topology and dynamics. Here we introduce a minimal population structure that is
described by two distinct hierarchical levels of interaction. We believe this
model is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend on
the details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution of
a system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processes
through two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of population
structure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: the
effective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of local
dynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of a
continuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populations
with hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratio
becomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatial
structure to the repeated prisoner's dilemma we uncover a novel and
counterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustains
cooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner's
dilemma and also of the ""rock-paper-scissor"" game we find indications of rich
structure and are able to reproduce several effects observed in other models
with explicit spatial embedding, such as the maintenance of biodiversity and
the emergence of global oscillations.

Torsional oscillations of longitudinally inhomogeneous coronal loops,"  We explore the effect of an inhomogeneous mass density field on frequencies

Dispersion relations for torsional oscillations are derived analytically in

frequency reduction results from the decrease of an average Alfven speed as far
as the inhomogeneous loop is denser at its footpoints. The derived dispersion

output. Consequently, we propose pseudo-random puncturing as a means of
improving the bandwidth efficiency of a PCCC and simultaneously lowering its
error floor.

most important applications expected from spintronics devices exploiting the

by large angle precessions in the absence of any applied field, as this is also
predicted by simulation with such a wavy angular dependence of the torque. This
type of non-standard nanopillars can represent an interesting way for the

around a body with an axisymmetric mass quadrupole moment Q to linear order in
Q, to the leading post-Newtonian order, and to linear order in the mass ratio.
This system admits three constants of the motion in absence of radiation
reaction: energy, angular momentum, and a third constant analogous to the
Carter constant. We compute instantaneous and time-averaged rates of change of
these three constants. For a point particle orbiting a black hole, Ryan has
computed the leading order evolution of the orbit's Carter constant, which is
linear in the spin. Our result, when combined with an interaction quadratic in
the spin (the coupling of the black hole's spin to its own radiation reaction
field), gives the next to leading order evolution. The effect of the
quadrupole, like that of the linear spin term, is to circularize eccentric
orbits and to drive the orbital plane towards antialignment with the symmetry
axis. In addition we consider a system of two point masses where one body has a
single mass multipole or current multipole. To linear order in the mass ratio,
to linear order in the multipole, and to the leading post-Newtonian order, we
show that there does not exist an analog of the Carter constant for such a

Feedback from first radiation sources: H- photodissociation,"  During the epoch of reionization, the formation of radiation sources is
accompanied by the growth of a H- photodissociating flux. We estimate the
impact of this flux on the formation of molecular hydrogen and cooling in the
first galaxies, assuming different types of radiation sources (e.g. Pop II and
Pop III stars, miniquasars). We find that H- photodissociation reduces the
formation of H2 molecules by a factor of ~1+1000k_s*x/(f_esc*delta), where x is
the mean ionized fraction in the IGM, f_esc is the fraction of ionizing photons
that escape from their progenitor halos, delta is the local gas overdensity and
k_s is an order unity constant which depends on the type of radiation source.
By the time a significant fraction of the universe becomes ionized, H-
photodissociation may significantly reduce the H2 abundance and, with it, the

Giant Planet Migration in Viscous Power-Law Discs,"  Many extra-solar planets discovered over the past decade are gas giants in
tight orbits around their host stars. Due to the difficulties of forming these

simply the viscous drift speed of the disc. However, this result can be

Modeling Accretion Disk X-ray Continuum of Black Hole Candidates,"  We critically examine issues associated with determining the fundamental
properties of the black hole and the surrounding accretion disk in an X-ray
binary based on modeling the disk X-ray continuum of the source. We base our
work mainly on two XMM-Newton observations of GX 339-4, because they provided
high-quality data at low energies (below 1 keV) which are critical for reliably
modeling the spectrum of the accretion disk. A key issue examined is the
determination of the so-called ""color correction factor"", which is often

from a blackbody (due to electron scattering). This factor cannot be
pre-determined theoretically because it may vary with, e.g., mass accretion
rate, among a number of important factors. We follow up on an earlier

quasiclassical Eilenberger theory, we calculate the three dimensional structure
of pair potentials, internal magnetic fields, paramagnetic moments, and
electronic states, for the s-wave and the d-wave pairings comparatively. The
\pi-phase shift of the pair potential at the FFLO nodal plane or at the vortex
core induces sharp peak states in the local density of states, and enhances the
local paramagnetic moment. We also discuss the NMR spectrum and the neutron
scattering as methods to detect the FFLO structure.

"Vortex state in a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov superconductor based
  on the quasiclassical theory","The Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state in superconductors has been a topic of interest in recent years due to its potential application in various fields such as quantum computing and high-precision sensors. In this paper, we investigate the vortex state in a FFLO superconductor using the quasiclassical theory. Our main objective is to understand the behavior of vortices in the FFLO state and their impact on the superconducting properties. We find that the FFLO state exhibits unique vortex dynamics compared to conventional superconductors, where vortices can form a lattice with a non-uniform density distribution. Our simulations show that the vortex lattice can be tuned by adjusting the external magnetic field and the FFLO wave vector. Additionally, we observe a significant enhancement of the critical current density in the FFLO state, which can be attributed to the suppression of pair-breaking effects. Our findings suggest that the FFLO state has great potential for practical applications that require high current-carrying capacity and robustness against external perturbations.",True,1
Optimal Shape Design for Stokes Flow Via Minimax Differentiability,"  This paper is concerned with a shape sensitivity analysis of a viscous
incompressible fluid driven by Stokes equations with nonhomogeneous boundary
condition. The structure of shape gradient with respect to the shape of the
variable domain for a given cost function is established by using the
differentiability of a minimax formulation involving a Lagrangian functional
combining with function space parametrization technique or function space
embedding technique. We apply an gradient type algorithm to our problem.
Numerical examples show that our theory is useful for practical purpose and the
proposed algorithm is feasible.

"Kinematic Decoupling of Globular Clusters with Extended
  Horizontal-Branch","  About 25% of the Milky Way globular clusters (GCs) exhibit unusually extended
color distribution of stars in the horizontal-branch (HB) phase. This
phenomenon is now best understood as due to the presence of helium enhanced
second generation subpopulations, which has raised a possibility that these
peculiar GCs might have a unique origin. Here we show that these GCs with
extended HB are clearly distinct from other normal GCs in kinematics and mass.
The GCs with extended HB are more massive than normal GCs, and are dominated by
random motion with no correlation between kinematics and metallicity.
Surprisingly, however, when they are excluded, most normal GCs in the inner
halo show clear signs of dissipational collapse that apparently led to the
formation of the disk. Normal GCs in the outer halo share their kinematic
properties with the extended HB GCs, which is consistent with the accretion
origin. Our result further suggests heterogeneous origins of GCs, and we
anticipate this to be a starting point for more detailed investigations of
Milky Way formation, including early mergers, collapse, and later accretion.

"Kinematic Decoupling of Globular Clusters with Extended
  Horizontal-Branch","Globular clusters (GCs) are spherical groups of stars that orbit around the galactic center. The horizontal branch (HB) is a region in the HR diagram where stars are burning helium in their cores. In this study, we investigate the kinematic properties of GCs with extended HBs, using data from the Gaia mission. We discover that these GCs exhibit a kinematic decoupling, with their cores moving differently from their outer regions. We propose that this decoupling is due to the presence of multiple stellar populations with different ages and metallicities. Our results suggest that the formation and evolution of GCs are more complex than previously thought, and that the extended HB is a useful tracer of their kinematic properties.",True,1
Scalar potential model progress,"  Because observations of galaxies and clusters have been found inconsistent
with General Relativity (GR), the focus of effort in developing a Scalar
Potential Model (SPM) has been on the examination of galaxies and clusters. The
SPM has been found to be consistent with cluster cellular structure, the flow
of IGM from spiral galaxies to elliptical galaxies, intergalactic redshift
without an expanding universe, discrete redshift, rotation curve (RC) data
without dark matter, asymmetric RCs, galaxy central mass, galaxy central
velocity dispersion, and the Pioneer Anomaly. In addition, the SPM suggests a
model of past expansion, past contraction, and current expansion of the
universe. GR corresponds to the SPM in the limit in which the effect of the
Sources and Sinks approximate a flat scalar potential field such as between
clusters and on the solar system scale, which is small relative to the distance
to a Source.

"Phase structure of a surface model on dynamically triangulated spheres
  with elastic skeletons","  We find three distinct phases; a tubular phase, a planar phase, and the
spherical phase, in a triangulated fluid surface model. It is also found that
these phases are separated by discontinuous transitions. The fluid surface
model is investigated within the framework of the conventional curvature model
by using the canonical Monte Carlo simulations with dynamical triangulations.
The mechanical strength of the surface is given only by skeletons, and no
two-dimensional bending energy is assumed in the Hamiltonian. The skeletons are
composed of elastic linear-chains and rigid junctions and form a
compartmentalized structure on the surface, and for this reason the vertices of
triangles can diffuse freely only inside the compartments. As a consequence, an
inhomogeneous structure is introduced in the model; the surface strength inside
the compartments is different from the surface strength on the compartments.
However, the rotational symmetry is not influenced by the elastic skeletons;
there is no specific direction on the surface. In addition to the three phases
mentioned above, a collapsed phase is expected to exist in the low bending
rigidity regime that was not studied here. The inhomogeneous structure and the
fluidity of vertices are considered to be the origin of such variety of phases.

"Vortex Dynamics at the Initial Stage of Resistive Transition in
  Superconductors with Fractal Cluster Structure","  The effect of fractal normal-phase clusters on vortex dynamics in a
percolative superconductor is considered. The superconductor contains
percolative superconducting cluster carrying a transport current and clusters
of a normal phase, acting as pinning centers. A prototype of such a structure
is YBCO film, containing clusters of columnar defects, as well as the BSCCO/Ag
sheathed tape, which is of practical interest for wire fabrication. Transition
of the superconductor into a resistive state corresponds to the percolation
transition from a pinned vortex state to a resistive state when the vortices
are free to move. The dependencies of the free vortex density on the fractal
dimension of the cluster boundary as well as the resistance on the transport
current are obtained. It is revealed that a mixed state of the vortex glass
type is realized in the superconducting system involved. The current-voltage
characteristics of superconductors containing fractal clusters are obtained and
their features are studied.

The Veldkamp Space of Two-Qubits,"  Given a remarkable representation of the generalized Pauli operators of
two-qubits in terms of the points of the generalized quadrangle of order two,
W(2), it is shown that specific subsets of these operators can also be
associated with the points and lines of the four-dimensional projective space
over the Galois field with two elements - the so-called Veldkamp space of W(2).

"Fusion process studied with preequilibrium giant dipole resonance in
  time dependent Hartree-Fock theory","  The equilibration of macroscopic degrees of freedom during the fusion of
heavy nuclei, like the charge and the shape, are studied in the Time-Dependent
Hartree-Fock theory. The pre-equilibrium Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) is used
to probe the fusion path. It is shown that such isovector collective state is
excited in N/Z asymmetric fusion and to a less extent in mass asymmetric
systems. The characteristics of this GDR are governed by the structure of the
fused system in its preequilibrium phase, like its deformation, rotation and
vibration. In particular, we show that a lowering of the pre-equilibrium GDR
energy is expected as compared to the statistical one. Revisiting experimental
data, we extract an evidence of this lowering for the first time. We also
quantify the fusion-evaporation enhancement due to gamma-ray emission from the
pre-equilibrium GDR. This cooling mechanism along the fusion path may be
suitable to synthesize in the future super heavy elements using radioactive
beams with strong N/Z asymmetries in the entrance channel.
